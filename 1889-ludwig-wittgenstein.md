# 1889 Ludwig Wittgenstein

### Ludwig Wittgenstein <a href="#_fzo7gtpcrgbb" id="_fzo7gtpcrgbb"></a>

### Bio <a href="#_tnuo2b1dro69" id="_tnuo2b1dro69"></a>

(1889 - 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. He is considered by some to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.

From 1929 to 1947, Wittgenstein taught at the University of Cambridge. His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously. The first and best-known of this posthumous series is the 1953 book Philosophical Investigations.

His philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the Tractatus, and a later period, articulated primarily in the Philosophical Investigations, this Wittgenstein rejected many of the assumptions of the Tractatus, arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given language-game.

He served as an officer on the front line during World War I, where he was decorated a number of times for his courage;

He continues to influence current philosophical thought in topics as diverse as logic and language, perception and intention, ethics and religion, aesthetics and culture.

### Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus <a href="#_30bru8ilk6mo" id="_30bru8ilk6mo"></a>

_**“The limits of my language are the limits of my world”**_

_“To have constructed a theory of logic which is not at any point obviously wrong is to have achieved a work of extraordinary difficulty and importance. This merit, in my opinion, belongs to Mr Wittgenstein’s book, and makes it one which no serious philosopher can afford to neglect” -_ B.Russell

_“The whole sense of the book might be summed up in the following words: **what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence”**_

So Wittgenstein will propose that the reason philosophers have been agonizing to answer questions like “what is the meaning of my life? or is there a God?” is that actually language is insufficient at describing transcendental concepts. These questions are nonsensical, like asking how much paint is needed to be funnier than soundwaves? And it will be philosophy's job to clarify this.

Wittgenstein argues that **language has one primary function: to state facts**. Language is a logical picture of the world. A given proposition mirrors a given state of affairs. This leads Wittgenstein to regard a great many types of utterances as strictly nonsense. For example, since ethics is not any given state of affairs, language couldn’t possibly picture it; therefore, all propositions in the form of “action X is morally good” are nonsense.

#### 1-2.0141 - The world and facts <a href="#_n0912i1f6dax" id="_n0912i1f6dax"></a>

_**"1- The world is all that is the case...The world is the totality of facts, not of things".**_

Wittgenstein sees the world as consisting of facts, rather than the traditional, atomistic conception of a world made up of objects

States of affairs _(Sachverhalt)_ are the most basic kinds of facts _(tatsache)_, they do not affect other states of affairs, meanwhile a complex fact is for example “the pen is green” since that will affect the state of the paper, etc…

So the world is the sum total of true states of affairs (all that is the case), not things, but the relations between them (facts). For example “John has a black T-shirt and is hungry” ad infinitum

**Facts exist in **_**Logical space**_, this is effectively the realm of everything that is logically possible. These can be true or false like “X is 30 years old” or “X is 40 years old”, but it can’t be something illogical like “love is purple”

_“2.01 - A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects (things)”._ **Every object has a logical form that determines how and in what kinds of states of affairs it can occur**. For example a color cannot be predicated on Love (love is not an object but helps illustrate).

What Wittgenstein is suggesting is that t**he essence of any object is** not certain properties that hold it, but **the possibility of certain kinds of properties holding it**. So Aristotle's definition of a “rational animal” is just one of the possibilities, but humans for sure are not a number.

And a Unicorn could or not exist, since we can only state facts about the world that relate these things to other things and properties.

#### &#x20;<a href="#_b1q0t5mi2fmt" id="_b1q0t5mi2fmt"></a>

#### 2.02-2.063 - Objects <a href="#_x52mpng1azeg" id="_x52mpng1azeg"></a>

_“2.02 - Objects are simple”_. For instance, a chair is a complex object since it is made up of a seat, a back, and legs. Objects are simple when they can’t be analyzed further into parts (chair -> wood -> atom -> quarks -> strings-> ….?) Wittgenstein never gives an example of an object, asking "what is an object?" is like asking "what does everything have in common?"

Objects for Wittgenstein don't have properties; rather they form properties, “the points that form a circle” could be close to what he means.

_“If we may regard ‘Socrates is wise’ as an atomic fact we perceive that it contains the constituents ‘Socrates’ and ‘wise’. If an atomic fact is analysed as fully as possible (theoretical, not practical possibility is meant) the constituents finally reached may be called ‘simples’ or ‘objects’. **It is not contended by Wittgenstein that we can actually isolate the simple or have empirical knowledge of it**”_ - B. Russell

Objects have

* **Internal properties**: it’s logical form, what kind of object it is. They remain true no matter what so they make up the substance of the world. We can imagine worlds other than this one, but we cannot imagine worlds that do not have the same logical form as this one (without color or space i.e.)
* **External properties:** what is true of it

The material properties of the world are determined by objects being combined with other objects, so we can distinguish yellow from red by comparing them.

_“2.031|2 - In a state of affairs objects fit into one another like the links of a chain... and stand in a determinate relation to one another”._ **There is no metaphysical glue**, like Spinoza’s substance**, that binds objects together in a particular state of affairs.**

**Substance**

If the world had no substance then "purple is a color" would be a contingent fact, just like "that lampshade is purple." If "purple is a color" were contingent, that means it could be otherwise; it could be that purple is a number. And if purple were a number, then "that lampshade is purple" would be nonsense. This is why _"2.0211 - If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true"_

#### 2.1–3.144 - **Pictures** <a href="#_1ex903eryswn" id="_1ex903eryswn"></a>

We represent facts to ourselves by means of pictures, like “I picture myself a brown horse” thus conceiving of something is a matter of picturing it to ourselves and therefore if we can conceive it we can make a logical picture

**Logical pictures represent possible situations**, which we can then compare with reality and they are the sense of the picture.

_"3 - A logical picture of facts is a thought"_. Because thoughts must share the logical form of what they are about, **it is impossible to have an illogical thought**, like "the number two is purple”

_“3.01 - The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world”._ So what we can think of is what constitutes the world.

**Propositions**

_“3.1 - In a proposition a thought finds an expression that can be perceived by the senses”_

**We express thoughts by means of propositions**. A sentence is what we utter and a proposition is what is said.

_“3.12 - I call the sign with which we express a thought a propositional sign”._

Wittgenstein calls a sentence a "propositional sign": it is a written or spoken manifestation of a proposition, which are facts

A proposition does not say what relation holds between its elements; rather, that relation is what makes the proposition sayable.

_“3.1432 - Instead of, ‘The complex sign “aRb” says that a stands to b in the relation R’, we ought to put, ‘That “a” stands to “b” in a certain relation says that aRb.’”_

#### 3.2–3.5 - Names and sings <a href="#_innm5dymjkwx" id="_innm5dymjkwx"></a>

_“3.144 - Situations can be described but not given names. (Names are like points; propositions like arrows— they have sense)”_

**Names themselves cannot be defined**, so we cannot say what they mean. Instead, **we must show what they mean through “elucidations”**

_“3.263 - The meanings of primitive signs can be explained by means of elucidations. **Elucidations are propositions that contain the primitive signs**. So they can only be understood if the meanings of those signs are already known”_

**Signs**

A sign in a perfect language will have a unique meaning but this does not occur in natural languages. **A sign has no meaning independent of its use**

Witggenstein solves Russell’s paradox by explaining that for example, **the functions in "F(F(fx))"** actually range over different kinds of variables so they **do not actually hold the same meaning.** Accordingly, a function cannot be used to talk about itself (a set cannot contain itself), since that would be to give it two different uses.

#### 4–4.116 - Science and philosophy <a href="#_og8l2u28mnpp" id="_og8l2u28mnpp"></a>

_“4 - **A thought is a proposition with a sense”**_

_“4.001 - **The totality of propositions is language.”**_

The sense of a proposition does not need to be made clear by means of elucidations. Like one just needs a sheet of music to translate writing into sound.

_“4.021 - A proposition is a picture of reality: for if I understand a proposition, I know the situation that it represents. And I understand the proposition without having had its sense explained to me.”_

**Natural science uses propositions to make claims** (true or false**) about how things stand in the world**. Meanwhile philosophy is as an "activity" whose business is not of saying, but of showing: **philosophy clarifies the logical structure of our propositions that is clouded by everyday language.**

_“4.11 - **The totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science”**_

_“4.111 - Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences. ‘Philosophy’ must mean something whose place is above or below the natural sciences, not beside them.”_

_“4.112 - Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. **Philosophy is** not a body of doctrine but **an activity**. **A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations**. Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries”_

#### 4.12–4.128 - Concepts <a href="#_xse1n9u4kvxw" id="_xse1n9u4kvxw"></a>

**A formal concept defines the formal properties of an object**, state of affairs, or fact. Formal concepts are to be sharply **distinguished from concepts proper**, while a concept proper can be expressed as a function and can feature in propositions, a formal concept cannot be spoken about at all.

_“4.121\* - Propositions show the logical form of reality… What can be shown, cannot be said.”_

A proposition can depict all of reality but not logical forms, it can only show it (since it is internal to itself)

**Formal vs proper concepts**

_“4.1272 -_ The variable name ‘x’ is the proper sign for the pseudo-concept object.. For example, in the proposition, ‘There are 2 objects which…’, it is expressed by ‘(∃x, y)...’ _one cannot say, for example, ‘There are objects’, as one might say, ‘There are books’. **it is nonsensical to speak of the total number of objects.”**_

_“4.128 - Logical forms are without number.“_

**The "fundamental idea" is to say that we cannot talk about logic: logic is something that shows itself**.

(Although Wittgenstein is doing exactly that in this book he will mystify his way out of it at the end of the book)

#### 4.2–5.156 - Elementary propositions <a href="#_b829ihrxw58k" id="_b829ihrxw58k"></a>

Elementary propositions are the simplest kind; they consist of names and depict a possible state of affairs. They are either true or false.

**Wittgenstein’s notation**

_"if p then q"_ can be expressed linearly as: "_(TTFT)(p,q)"._ From this notation it becomes clear that **there are no "logical objects," such as a sign expressing the conditional**. “_It is quite impossible for a proposition to state that it itself is true”._

Wittgenstein is responsible for popularizing truth tables in this work.

There are 2 extreme cases in the groups of truth-conditions:

* _**Tautologies**:_ All are true
* _**Contradictions**:_ All are false

**Both say nothing and lack sense, but they are not nonsensical**. “_For example, I know nothing about the weather when I know that it is either raining or not raining_”.

_“4.464 - A tautology’s truth is certain, a proposition is possible, a contradiction is impossible”_

The sense of a proposition is given if its truth conditions are given. If we know under what circumstances a proposition is true and under what circumstances it is false, then we know all there is to know about that proposition. If I know what would have to be the case for _"Your dog is eating my hat"_ to be true or false, then I can be said to know what that proposition means.

#### Freedom <a href="#_2hl3fcyi37ik" id="_2hl3fcyi37ik"></a>

_“5.13\* - All deductions are made a priori. There is no possible way of making an inference from the existence of one situation to the existence of another, entirely different situation._

_“There is no causal nexus to justify such an inference. **We cannot infer the events of the future from those of the present.** Superstition is nothing but belief in the causal nexus._

_**The freedom of the will consists in the impossibility of knowing actions that still lie in the future**. We could know them only if causality were an inner necessity like that of logical inference.—The connexion between knowledge and what is known is that of logical necessity. (‘A knows that p is the case’, has no sense if p is a tautology.)_

Although Wittgenstein talks of the “probability” of each proposition (i.e: VVFV|p,q) this is just for studying _“5.153 - In itself, a proposition is neither probable nor improbable. Either an event occurs or it does not: there is no middle way”._ We only use probability when we don't know the full state (like taking marbles of different colors from an urn)

#### 5.2–5.4611 - Logical objects <a href="#_emzifv3unvib" id="_emzifv3unvib"></a>

_“5.4 - **there are no ‘logical objects’** or ‘logical constants’ (in Frege’s and Russell’s sense).”_

Frege used ‘∼’ and ‘⇒’ as primitives and Russell used ‘∼’ and ‘∨’. But they are in fact interchangeable ( ‘p ⇒ q’ can be expressed as ‘q ∨ ∼p’ and ‘p ∨ q’ can be ‘∼p⇒ q’). So **there’s nothing fundamental about them.**

_“5.44 - For example, an affirmation can be produced by double negation: in such a case does it follow that in some sense negation is contained in affirmation? Does ‘∼∼p’ negate ∼p, or does it affirm p—or both?”_

**Logic for Wittgenstein is utterly general and simple**. There cannot be a hierarchy of primitive propositions of logic from which other propositions are then derived. And we should not have a lot of symbols rather every symbol used needs to be extremely well thought about before even introducing it to logic

#### 5.47–5.54 <a href="#_6kjqoxgitgs1" id="_6kjqoxgitgs1"></a>

**All the "laws of logic" must be given in advance, and all at once.**

_“5.473 - **Logic must look after itself**"_. Logic doesn’t need external "rules" to work, **it is the realm of everything that is possible and conceivable.** Any proposition that lacks sense does so because we have not given a meaning to the signs in the proposition. “_The reason why ‘Socrates is identical’ says nothing is that we have not given any adjectival meaning to the word ‘identical’._ Not __ because the symbol in itself is illegitimate_...In a certain sense, we cannot make mistakes in logic”_

To Wittgenstein a proposition can be contradictory but still be logical, i.e. _"It is raining and it is not raining"_ is contradictory, but makes sense and can be expressed as "p.\~p," whereas there is no †proposition that can express "Purple is three years old." which is nonsensical. Thus, according to Wittgenstein, we don't need laws to tell us what is logical and what isn't. **Everything that can be said is logical, and whatever isn't logical cannot be said.**

Sheffer showed that all truth-functions of a given set of propositions can be constructed out of either of the two functions ‘not-p or not-q’ or ‘not-p and not-q’. So anything can be represented as successives (\~\~T). Wittgenstein abbreviates this terminology to N(‾ξ) _“5.502 - instead of ‘(-----T)(ξ,...)’, I write ‘N(_‾ξ_)’”_

Not even ‘=’ is necessary since _"5.5303 - to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is to say nothing at all"_

#### 5.541–5.641 - The problem of the logical form of belief <a href="#_n1wu1rsmwrh6" id="_n1wu1rsmwrh6"></a>

Wittgenstein looks at the issue of “**A says/believes/hopes p**”, which Frege solved with his oblique contexts. But for Wittgenstein any proposition of t**his form does not actually involve a relationship between A and p.** It is a proposition of the form ** **_**“p says p”**_

For A to think, believe, or say that p is the case, the words that constitute the verbal utterance of p must occur to A. **It is then not A but these words that are related to p**, and the internal similarity between the words and the proposition is obvious.

Wittgenstein further infers that **there is no such thing as a "soul" where thoughts and beliefs reside.** There is no unified "self" that exists such that it can hold the place of an object in a proposition ("A thinks that p") . Rather, the soul is a composite made up of the numerous different thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes that it entertains. Thus, **when we talk about a person's belief it is not a belief outside of its consciousness.** For Wittgenstein there is not a self that is somehow distinct from, and more essential than, the thoughts, ideas, and beliefs that constitute it.

We cannot learn a priori what kinds of objects or elementary propositions there are. Logic is prior to any particular experience, but not prior to the fact of experience itself: it is the shape experience takes

_**"5.6 - The limits of my language mean the limits of my world"**_

**Solipsism**

Wittgenstein analyses the idea of solipsism he tries to figure out where does the metaphysical subject fits in the world, he draws an analogy between “metaphysical subject and the world” and between “the eye and the visual field”

I cannot see my eye anywhere in my visual field, but the existence of a visual field presupposes the existence of the eye. Similarly, **my self is not something I encounter in the world, but my experience of the world presupposes that there is a self to experience it**. However, I cannot talk about this myself because it is outside the limits of the world, and hence outside the limits of language.

So there is no real distinction between solipsism and pure realism. The solipsist's idea of a self is not something that can be expressed. Any disagreement between them will be in the form of pseudo-propositions that try to make unsayable claims about the nature of the self or the world.

#### 6–6.241 - The general form of a proposition![](.gitbook/assets/0) <a href="#_uz9zc3xfrskw" id="_uz9zc3xfrskw"></a>

_"6 - The general form of a proposition is “_

* ‾p stands for all atomic propositions.
* ‾ξ stands for any set of propositions.
* N(‾ξ ) stands for the negation of all the propositions making up ξ -

Every proposition is built from an initial set of elementary propositions (‾p) that are then transformed into a more complex proposition through successive applications of the negating operation, "N(‾ξ)." Thus, propositions generally are produced through successive applications of an operation.

**Propositions of logic are all tautologies**, they all say nothing so there is no real need to prove them.

_“6.1222 - Logical propositions cannot be confirmed by experience any more than they can be refuted by it. Not only must a proposition of logic be irrefutable by any possible experience, but it must also be unconfirmable by any possible experience.”_

**Numbers**

_"Mathematics is a logical method" (6.2)_. Numbers can be derived from the successive application of operations and mathematical propositions are all equations; it thus follows that they do not tell us anything, but simply express an equivalence of form, they are just abstractions that help us to infer propositions about the world (6.211).

(This idea relies on the concept of “and so on” defined by Kant, who explained through pure intuition we can form numbers as the addition of 1s. Frege and Russell tried to remove intuition although both run into paradoxes trying to do so)

**The scaffolding metaphor**

_“**The propositions of logic describe the scaffolding of the world,** or rather they represent it.”(6.124)_

4 aspects of Wittgenstein's conception of logic:

1. As a framework structure, it is a skeleton of joints rather than a building. Similarly, **logic** does not consist of propositions with a sense, but **only provides a framework within which propositions with a sense may fit**.
2. Scaffolding is used to construct a more substantial building, just as **logic provides a framework within which the substantial facts about the world may fit.**
3. Scaffolding has points of contact with the building it is placed against, but it is not a part of the building. Logic has points of contact with the world in that both logic and the world share a logical form, but the content (as opposed to the form) of facts themselves has no analogue in logic.
4. A complete building has no need of scaffolding. Similarly, _"all the propositions of our everyday language, just as they stand, are in perfect logical order"._ **We do not need logic or philosophy when language is functioning normally**. These tools are only needed to provide clarity when language attempts to speak nonsense. (philosophies job)

### &#x20;<a href="#_phakm78m1ij9" id="_phakm78m1ij9"></a>

#### 6.3–6.3751 - Laws of science <a href="#_dajba0o12q8j" id="_dajba0o12q8j"></a>

Logic determines the form of natural laws but not their nature. Scientific principles (like causality) are _"6.34 **-a priori insights about the forms in which the propositions of science can be cast"**._ They **define the framework within which we can talk about natural phenomena.**

Wittgenstein uses a metaphor of a mesh laid out over a black and white surface, the mesh can be squared, triangular or hexagonal and certain kinds of mesh will describe the surface better and simpler but they do not say anything about the actual distribution of the surface.

In the same way **the laws of nature do not tell us anything about the world, nor are they necessarily true of the world. Rather, they are tools we can use to make sense of the world.**

“_6.35 - Although the spots in our picture are geometrical figures, nevertheless geometry can obviously say nothing at all about their actual form and position. The network, however, is purely geometrical; all its properties can be given a priori. **Laws like the principle of sufficient reason, etc. are about the net and not about what the net describes”**_

For example the law of causality amounts to nothing more than a belief that things happen for a reason, the laws of nature exist to tell us just that: there are regularities in nature _“6.32 - **The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.”**_

We think that we have identified the fundamental truths about the workings of the world, when **in fact we have simply developed a framework** within which we can think about the workings of the world. This framework may in many ways be more powerful than superstition, but they work according to the same principle: **both scientific laws and superstition provide explanations for why things happen the way they do**. In both cases, **however, the explanations themselves are not found in nature, but are found in the framework we adopt.**

#### 6.4–7 <a href="#_40zdeqfec0i9" id="_40zdeqfec0i9"></a>

_**"6.4 - All propositions are of equal value".**_ Everything in the world is accidental, so nothing can have transcendent value. Any meaning must lie outside the world.

That's why ethics and aesthetics cannot be put into words, because they make judgments of value

While the exercise of the will has no direct effect on the world itself, this exercise of the will defines the kind of world a person inhabits: _"6.43 - The world of the happy man is a different one from that of the unhappy man"_

Our attitude toward the world shapes the world we live in, and it is this general shape of the world and not some deontological or utilitarian maxim.

_“6.53 - The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: **to say nothing except what can be said,** i.e. propositions of natural science and then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to the other person—he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy—this method would be the only strictly correct one.”_

Wittgenstein acknowledges that all the propositions of the Tractatus are themselves nonsensical, and that they are to be used, only as steps, _"to climb up beyond them_ _and throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it”_

_**“7 -What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.”**_

### Philosophical Investigations <a href="#_8jhm4aveiq2" id="_8jhm4aveiq2"></a>

**Summary**

Unlike the Tractatus here Wittgenstein aims not at erecting a whole edifice of thought, but at destroying other edifice

Wittgenstein replaces his old picture metaphor with a new tool metaphor. Instead of a word being meaningful because it pictures a fact, **the meaning of a word is synonymous with the social use of that word.**

Instead of the reference to a type of object being primary, **the social use is primary.**“Pizza” means pizza because you can use the word to order it, not because it means the name.

There's a replacement of the objective/subjective dichotomy with the notion of public, social behavior.

Traditionally it was thought that language reported objective states of affairs, or subjective internal experiences.

Against the objective state of affairs Wittgenstein shows that for example “game” can’t be defined, there is no single quality that the word refers to. Rather, the word “game” takes on different meanings in different contexts, different “language games” like joking, philosophizing, religious or scientific discourse.

**Every language game has its own rules;** so we can’t have a unique theory of language (like the Tractatus) because it attempts to reduce the irreducible. You cannot reduce chess or soccer to one set of rules and neither language.

Against the internal theory, propositions mean things by referring to thoughts or sensations. When I refer to pain, I am referring to an internal object; when I refer to a bunny, I am referring to a set of visual sensations that I have learned to call ‘bunny’.

Wittgenstein points out that our ‘sensations’ of an object are not something that we experience purely. Rather, our interpretations alter the sensations themselves. For example the the duck-rabbit:

![duckrabbit](.gitbook/assets/1)

If you had never seen a duck or a rabbit in your life, the picture would look rather strange. Ernst Gombrich summed up as: _“If we look out of the window we can see the view in a thousand different ways. Which of them is our sense impression?”_

So the way we see things is based on our pre-existing beliefs and experiences. With feelings the same issue occurs, we only know what pain is because of its public use, we can’t even be sure other people experience the same feeling as we do. It’s part of our private language.

If we have a feeling that nobody has given a name to, and we create a name for it. How can we know if we’re using the name correctly? Therefore, merely thinking you’re using the name consistently and actually using the name consistently would be indistinguishable experiences. You could never really know.

#### Part I, sections 1–20 <a href="#_gxcijqlqdk2" id="_gxcijqlqdk2"></a>

_**“Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination.”**_

Wittgenstein begins by quoting St. Augustine who describes the process of learning a language in terms of learning the names of objects, called ostentation, pointing objects and naming them.

A proper read shows that Wittgenstein is not directly challenging Augustine. He is just using such simplified examples as the theoretical reading of Augustine **to show us the dangers of isolating and inferring general conclusions from particular aspects of how we speak and think**. To prevent us from theorizing too hastily from a particular example to a general conclusion. (The way he himself did in the Tractatus)

Wittgenstein imagines, for instance, a language consisting of just 4 words: block, pillar, slab and beam where a builder shouts one of these orders and his assistant fetches the object he names.

Our word "slab" is very different from the builders' word “slab” and this difference has everything to do with the language that has been built up around this word. So **words get their sense from the language that surrounds them, from context** and we cannot fruitfully isolate particular words and talk about their connection with the world.

The relationship between words and things can only be seen to exist once a great deal of the machinery of language, context, and usage are already in place. (Augustine’s idea of learning through ostension can only be true for learning a second language, otherwise we would not have the necessary preconditions)

Meaning is not fixed by the relationship between words and things, but by how words are used.

#### Part I, sections 21–64 <a href="#_gdoxg2hzrgil" id="_gdoxg2hzrgil"></a>

**Names**

A name is simply a label, and a definition of words as names presupposes that we already know what to do with these labels

**Composites and simples**

The issue with simples:

1. It is not clear what counts as simple, is it white a simple or is it a composite of all the colors of the rainbow, or a chair with moisture, without…
2. Naming (without a definition) tells us only the role of the word in our language.
3. Breaking composites into components doesn't always give simple solutions, like "brooms" could be called "broomsticks attached to a brush". (Compositions require context)

_"**The meaning of a word is its use in the language."**_ The key is not to discover how language connects with reality, but to realize that questioning how language connects with reality is prompted by a distorted picture of what language is.

**Composites**

_“It is formed by simples, but what is an actual comp_

_We use the word "composite" in an enormous number of different and differently related ways. Is white simple, or does it consist of the colours of the rainbow?—Is this length of 2 cm. simple, or does it consist of two parts, each 1 cm long?) To the philosophical question: "Is the visual image of this tree a composite, and what are its component parts?" the correct answer is: **"That depends on what you understand by 'composite'."**_

For example we could imagine an alien race that came to earth and by seeing that dogs are always close to trees they believe them to be 1 entity, a “trog” that is the closest tree to the closest dog. Or in the image with 9 squares, do we see 9 squares, 3 rows? a cube? **it will depend on how our language is created, what we see and what we call a composite**![](.gitbook/assets/2)

_“Let us imagine a language game altered so that names signify not monochrome squares but rectangles each consisting of two such squares. Let such a rectangle, which is half red half green, be called "U"; a half green half white one, "V"; and so on. C**ould we not imagine people who had names for such combinations of colour, but not for the individual colours?”**_

#### Part I, sections 65–91 <a href="#_uucfrr9eco7" id="_uucfrr9eco7"></a>

**Language is like a game.**

The things we call "language" are related to one another, but they do not all share a defining characteristic. In Language as in games, we can’t find one feature in common but simply a number of relationships between kinds of games. Wittgenstein calls this ** **_**"family resemblance"**_** ** that is **we don't always need exact definitions and clear boundaries to make words usable**. Often a word with unclear boundaries is exactly what we need, and attempts to provide sharp definition will necessarily distort its meaning.

_“Consider for example the proceedings that we call "games". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all?—Don't say: "There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games' "—**but look and see whether there is anything common to all.**—For if you look at them **you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities,**  **relationships**, and a whole series of them at that. **To repeat: don't think, but look**!”_

_“And the result of this examination is: **we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail”**_

_**‘Games' form a family.**_

Even something like the word chair might seem to have fixed meaning because there are a number of objects that without doubt we call chairs, but there are also borderline cases, how much of a chair do we need to remove for it not to be one, how many legs, what about the material. **To a large extent, whether or not we call an object a chair depends on the context**

**There are no clear boundaries**

_And this is how we do use the word "game". For how is the concept of a game bounded? What still counts as a game and what no longer does? **Can you give the boundary? No. You can draw one; for none has so far been drawn. (But that never troubled you before when you used the**_** word "game".)**

**Rules**

Definitions of words are like rules in a game:

1. **Rules do not cover all cases.** Like what happens if a player swallows a dice, nothing in the rules cover this. Rules and boundaries are only clear when dealing with the situations we are familiar with, but no set of rules or boundaries can cover all possible situations.
2. **Rules in themselves do not remove all doubt**. Imagine a table as a rule, where left-hand items correspond to right-hand items. We can’t tell how to read it just by that, do we follow a straight line, does the arrow go from left to right (in hebrew it would go the other way)

Wittgenstein's point is not that rules are useless, but that there is a point where we simply follow a rule without any explicit justification.

Witrgenstein criticizes the search for a logically ideal world of essences (his own previous position)

A perfect logical language would mean every sentence is totally clear, with no uncertainty. But everyday speech is full of uncertainty and vagueness.

_"We have got on to slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk: so we need friction. Back to the rough ground!_" (logical language = ice, real language = ground)

We must abandon this ideal logical language and recognize there is no essence. **"Language" is a series of more or less related family resemblances.**

The key to understanding language is not to identify the hidden structure of propositions but to appreciate how we actually use language to say what we need to say.

Philosophy does not tell us things we did not know; it reminds us of what we have always known by putting it clearly before our eyes.

_“What is your aim in philosophy?—To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.”_

Wittgestein in these chapters performs a 180 degree turn against traditional philosophy, from ideal to ordinary language and away from complex theories.

Wittgenstein's method can be called "therapeutic” and he tries to remind us of the various contexts in which words such as "knowledge" make sense, and how they have no meaning beyond what we find in those contexts.

**Understanding is a state**

Is understanding a mental state? Unlike pain or joy, understanding is not continuous nor does it happen in a given time. When does someone understand that after a series 2,4,6,8.. comes 10 and then 12? **Understanding is determined by the particular circumstance**s in each case that justify us in saying we understand.

Psychology conceives knowledge as a mental mechanism of some sort that constitutes understanding but Wittgenstein argues that there is no such mechanism. **Understanding is a state**

Although **we must avoid reading Wittgenstein as a behaviorist**, someone who believes behavior itself is understanding

His goal is to counteract attempts to turn "understanding" into a technical term and include it in our psychological vocabulary.

Following rules

Wittgenstein gives an example of a student that has to follow the series of "Add two".. 2, 4,6,8 and he does so correctly until 1000, but after that writes 1004, 1008… On what grounds can we say he is following the rule incorrectly? We never explicitly said anything about numbers after 1000 but we assumed that he would follow the same.

The problem is that There is nothing in the formula itself that determines the steps. Without training, the formula is meaningless.

**Nothing in the rule tells us what is right or wrong.** We are forced to interpret the rule at every step.

So for Wittgenstein we can know what is the correct interpretation by saying **there is no correct interpretation and that is simply a matter of convention**. (we all "add two" in the same way)

Wittgestein is not being skeptical, he is showing that doubts such as “are we real?” can’t be open to doubt, since it would be impossible to communicate on anything.

**Not everything is open to doubt or interpretation or else we would not be able to understand one another.** If everyone had their own idea of what the rule “add two” was, then we could not even buy groceries

The point is that if rules were the kinds of things that constantly required interpretation and justification, they would not be of any use to us at all.

_**“What is your aim in philosophy?—To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle”**_ To help us navigate our lives, communicate and understand better with others.

**Private language**

We all have privileged access to our own inner sensations. I am directly aware of my pain, but everyone else can only see or be told about it.

In the same way, different people may have a totally different sensation of red. When we talk about "red" or “pain,” we refer to a common experience of what we call "red" not our own private sensations.

**We do not learn how to use "pain" from our own experience of it, but from our shared experience,** from observing other people having similar experiences and talking about them in similar ways.

Suppose everyone has a box with something in it, but people can only see the contents of their own box and nobody else's: different people may or may not have different things in their boxes. We could call this something a "beetle," but the word "beetle" does not play the role of a name in this language-game: what is actually in the box is irrelevant to how "beetle" is used. Private sensations are not objects that we refer to, because referring to them becomes irrelevant if only we experience them.

Wittgenstein represents this inner state and sensation words by imagining the following scenario

_“Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a “beetle.” No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle._

_Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box._

_But suppose the word "beetle" had a use in these people's language?—If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty.**—No, one can 'divide through' by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is.“**_

So the beetle is like pain or red, we can’t know how others experience it. Whatever is actually in the box is irrelevant, sensation words are only meaningful in the public sphere, in what we are able to teach each other.

In the end Wittgenstein does not arrive at any definite position, in a socratic manner he just discusses the different nature of private sensations and warns us to be cautious when philosophizing about private sensations.

_**“343. The words with which I express my memory are my memory reaction.”**_

_“384. You learned the concept 'pain' when you learned language.”_

**Language is a feeling**

Thinking, believing, and wishing are perfectly natural and unproblematic activities, but how are they possible? I can order a person to raise his arm, show him or explain it but I can not guarantee that he will understand. I cannot convey the picture itself, only represent it.

The meaning of a sentence cannot simply be a picture: we must also know how to apply that picture.

**Language is not just a means of communication**. Its sole purpose is not to create understanding in another person. **Words are not a lifeless medium through which we transmit living, bodiless "meanings"** from one person to another. Understanding a sentence is much like understanding a musical theme. **We can feel it but not understand its actual meaning.** Every word has ambiguities that depend on its context, intonation, etc… We can see it drastically in the uses of “is”, both as identity in "two plus two is four" and as copula in "the rose is red".

**Believes**

What is wrong with saying, "I believe that fire will burn me" is that this is not a belief in the sense that we normally take the word. There is nothing wrong with stating it as a belief, but we must recognize that it is not on the same level as believing “Argentina will win the world cup”.

**Different propositions are open to varying levels of doubt**.

Fruitful discussion relies on the fact we do not need to justify everything, we agree upon certain things. If I say I doubt that fire will burn me or "the world existed five minutes ago" we would sacrifice our ability to communicate.

As with previous topics Wittgenstein doesn’t resolve the issue, he just advises us not to follow these lines of questioning, but then leaves us where we started with a deeper understanding.

**Part I, sections 571–693**

**To will**

The act of willing can be uncaused, for example raising an arm willingly. We can only will or try to do things if there is some difficulty involved. **There is no intermediary between our voluntary actions and ourselves.** We cannot will them, nor can we observe them, predict them, or react with surprise to them. When I say I am going to do something, other people can predict my future actions based on this speech, but I make no such prediction.

Wittgenstein's main preoccupation is to analyze our tendency to think that words like "believe," "recognize," "wish," "mean," "expect," and so on correspond to particular mental states. We feel that there must be something more than just the words that constitutes the meaning, believing and so on.

But he wants to show us that questions of how we can believe, mean or expect things, do not expose difficult mental problems that we somehow pass over when believing in our everyday lives. **We are creating puzzles for ourselves that are contained** not in the act of believing, meaning, etc., but **in the forms of expression that we use to talk about these acts.**

In reality **the outward context in which an utterance is made contains all the necessary criteria for determining its meaning**. We don't need to look for something more in the mind to ground it.
