We can answer this in a very simple manner</span><span>: balance</span><span class="c0">. But to understand in more depth we need to see what this means for Socrates. He argues a person (or his soul as he would say) is divided in 3 parts. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">First there&#39;s the appetite, which is the part that desires, wants and craves. It tells us what it likes and dislikes. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Second there&#39;s the Spirit, this is the emotional part, it fights but it also stands up to aggression.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Finally and most importantly there&#39;s reason, it is the one that thinks about what&#39;s good and bad, right and wrong, it plans and analyzes. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Knowing this we can understand </span><span>Socrates&#39; thought</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;a bit better, he says a soul in balance is a just soul, one where all parts are aligned and working together. We can imagine a person in such balance, as someone that is not greedy since it knows this is wrong and does not let </span><span>its</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;appetite run free or someone who is compassionate and knows not to fight without cause but just as well knows to stand up against injustice when deemed fit. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">We can understand from this how a just person would behave when all parts are kept in check. Contrary to this we can </span><span>see</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;why being an unjust person would not be a good idea, we can envision someone who can&#39;t control </span><span>himself</span><span class="c0">, who has no self discipline and no balance. Someone who even with all the money or power in the world would still feel angry and resentful, someone without limits for his desires. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">We&#39;ve seen many times how people&#39;s desire can have no boundaries and how nothing is enough, wealthy people looking for more and more wealth and the powerful trying to get even more power. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">This type of life, unbalanced, is one that not only brings suffering to </span><span>its</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;own but also to those around it and it can&rsquo;t be solved by anything external but rather by retrospective thought </span><span>and trying</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to balance our inner being.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">That&#39;s why I believe being just as Socrates meant is so meaningful, </span><span>especially</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in our times where the extremes are more exaggerated than ever and the only road to a just world is one made from just people.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12 c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12 c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12 c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c14"></span></p><h2 class="c33 c17" id="h.8n8v8z3e22pu"><span class="c4 c25">The Symposium</span></h2><h3 class="c3" id="h.ypvqj5mdg08b"><span>Speeches</span><span class="c4 c16 c11">&nbsp;regarding love</span></h3><h4 class="c3 c27" id="h.cuyfebcs100p"><span class="c4 c31 c11"></span></h4><h4 class="c3" id="h.zhhqkoy2ofnp"><span class="c4 c11 c31">Phaedrus</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Phaedrus asserts that both gods and humans regard Love as great and awesome, is widely considered older than almost all the other gods, and has no parents.Chaos was the first thing in existence, followed by Earth and Love.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Love is then primordial and </span><span class="c4 c2">it&rsquo;s better than other pleasures since it does not lead to shame.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">No young man could derive greater benefit than from a good lover, and no lover could derive greater benefit than from a young loved one</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Phaedrus suggests that an army that consisted solely of lovers and loved ones would be unmatchable, as they would rather die than show cowardice in front of their partner, and they would all strive constantly for greater honor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">For example It was prophesied that Achilles would be killed if he killed Hector, but Achilles still hunted down and killed the man who had killed his lover.

So Love must be love of beauty, which in turn implies that Love itself must be wholly without beauty.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c3" id="h.1j5e8adcqlti"><span class="c19 c11">Diotima</span></h5><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Socrates continues by restating an account given to him by a woman named Diotima. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Having been convinced that Love is not beautiful or good, Socrates asks Diotima if that means Love is ugly and bad. Diotima argues that not everything must be either one thing or its opposite. For instance, having unjustified true opinions is neither wisdom nor ignorance. Wisdom consists in justified true opinions, but one would hardly call a true opinion ignorant.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>They have concluded that </span><span class="c11">Love is not good and beautiful because he is in need of good and beautiful things. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Love is neither mortal nor immortal, but is a spirit or daemon, which falls somewhere between being a god and being human. They serve as intermediaries between gods and humans. The gods never communicate directly with humans, but only through the medium of spirits, who are the source of all divination. There are many kinds of spirits, Love being but one. (The daemon that talked to Socrates being another example)</span></p><p class="c7"><span>The myth is that</span><span class="c29">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c10">Love is the child that Poverty conceived by Resource&rdquo;</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span>As their child Love is always poor, and, far from being sensitive, he is very tough, sleeping out of doors on the rough ground. Like his mother, </span><span class="c11">he is always in a state of need</span><span>, </span><span class="c11">but</span><span>&nbsp;like his father, </span><span class="c11">he can scheme to get what he wants</span><span>. Being neither mortal nor immortal, </span><span class="c4 c2">Love may shoot into life one day only to die the next and then return to life the following day.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Love falls between ignorance and wisdom because his father, Resource, is both wise and resourceful, while his mother, Poverty, is neither.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c48 c36 c31"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Socrates here sets himself up as the exemplar of Love. Love seeks wisdom, lives simply and is quite poor, he is tough and brave, all these qualities are his.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Socrates calls Love a </span><span class="c10">&quot;lover of wisdom&quot;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;quite literally a philosopher (philia = &quot;love&quot; and sophia = &quot;wisdom&quot;).</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Diotima dismisses the idea that lovers are in search of their other half, claiming instead that lovers love what is good. We would be willing to have limbs amputated if we thought they were diseased and bad, suggesting that we only want to be attached to what is good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Diotima&#39;s next move is to ask </span><span class="c4 c2">in what way people pursue love.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c11">Sex</span><span>&nbsp;is one means of giving birth, and</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;it is through reproduction that we achieve immortality. This process is divine and therefore beautiful.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;All mortal things desire reproduction, and we see this even in birds and animals: they seek partners desperately, and will protect their young with their lives.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Diotima points out that though we talk about the &quot;same person,&quot; we are not the same at all throughout our lives. Our body changes, as does our mind and our knowledge so that in old age we are nothing like what we were when we were young. We maintain ourselves in existence by replacing the old with the new, and so reproduction is just one further way of extending our lives.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">There are two ways men can become pregnant: in body and mind. Those who are pregnant seek out women with whom they can reproduce and create a bodily heir. Those who are pregnant in mind bring forth not bodies, but wisdom and other virtues. For Socrates (Plato) love can also be expressed through the reproduction of ideas where we become pregnant with the thoughts we have and must give birth to them, sharing them with others.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c3" id="h.vjvt0usxqwno"><span class="c19 c11">The theory of forms</span></h5><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Diotima shares with Socrates the process to arrive at the Form of Beauty:</span></p><ol class="c30 lst-kix_n0fowf90lu8z-0 start" start="1"><li class="c7 c20 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>One begins as a young boy by being </span><span class="c11">attracted to beautiful bodies,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and to one beautiful body in particular, and produces beautiful discourses with this body. </span></li><li class="c7 c20 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Next we recognize that all </span><span class="c11">bodies are relatively similar </span><span class="c0">and that it is foolish to love only one body in particular. </span></li><li class="c7 c20 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>We will come to </span><span class="c11">appreciate the beauty of minds,</span><span>&nbsp;and will be able to love those who are beautiful in mind whether or not they are beautiful in body.
