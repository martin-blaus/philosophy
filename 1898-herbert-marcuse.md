### One dimensional man <a href="#_bwubi72hff3r" id="_bwubi72hff3r"></a>

**The one dimensional man**

He **has lost individuality, freedom, and the ability to dissent** and to control one's own destiny. It conforms to pre-existing structures and norms**. The subject is assimilated into the object and follows the dictates of external**, objective norms and structures, thus losing the ability to discover more liberating possibilities and to engage in transformative practice to realize them

Society shapes aspirations, hopes, fears, and values, and even manipulates vital needs. **The price that one-dimensional man pays for satisfaction is to surrender freedom and individuality.**

One-dimensional man does not know its true needs because **its needs are not its own.** It submits to increasingly total domination. We only want to travel because others travel or a house or children because it’s the “American dream”.

**As Adorno said we become fungible, we are all one and the same person,** and what could be more totalitarian than that?

Marcuse calls this state a new form of alienation, **we are alienated from reality.** **We can’t even see the indoctrination** we are suffering, we are completely incapable of thinking outside the box created by technological progress.

**Multidimensional Man**

Someone who **focuses on possibilities that transcend the established state of affairs**, the subject is **free to perceive possibilities** in the world that do not yet exist but which can be realized.

Prior to industrial advanced society man was two dimensional, we internalized the dominant ideology of the time but had an awareness of that indoctrination and maintained a negative, a critical view.

**The new forms of control**

Marcuse explains that **our idea that a totalitarian regime is one of terror like that of Nazis** or Communism where voices are silenced and opposition eliminated is ideological, but actually **this just serves to cover up that totalitarian tendencies** are beginning to show even **in democratic societies**.

Marcuse defines **totalitarianism as “**_**the situation in which the private and the public of the individual is controlled and standardized, with imposed values and needs**. Which is a consequence of technical progress through mass production and mass distribution_

_done by mass media and requires consumers to be normalized”_ So even **a democracy can be a totalitarian regime.**

_“Contemporary industrial society tends to be totalitarian. For "**totalitarian**" is not only a terroristic political coordination of society, but also **a non-terroristic economic-technical coordination which operates through the manipulation of needs by vested interests**._

_Not only a specific form of government or party rule makes for totalitarianism, but also a specific system of production and distribution which may well be compatible with a "pluralism" of parties, newspapers, " countervailing powers," etc.'”_

**Automation and technology were supposed to give us more free time,** but instead it imposes itself in our work and in our free time as well, **we are constantly attached to our phones** and we don't stop to think critically by ourselves for even 1 minute.

**Human needs**

* **True:** These are vital needs
* **False:** Are imposed on the individual by society, they _“perpetuate toil, aggressiveness, misery, and injustice...most of the prevailing needs to relax, to have fun, to behave and **consume in accordance with the advertisements**, **to love and hate what others love and hate,** belong to this category of false needs.”_

_**The people recognize themselves in their commodities;** they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment. **Social control is anchored in the new needs which it has produced.”**_

**The irrationality of society**

Totalitarian **pursuit of efficiency** and profit uses **rational means but its result is irrational and it ends up oppressing, dominating and destroying the world**. We are willing to sit a third of our lives working on a job we don't like. We can see totalitarianism evin in kindergarten where kids are forced to stay between 4 walls and salute the flag every morning, a permanent discipline as Foucault would say.

_**“The union of growing productivity and growing destruction**; the brinkmanship of annihilation; **the surrender of thought,** hope, and fear **to the powers that be**; **the preservation of misery** in the face of **unprecedented wealth** constitutes the most impartial indictment: **its sweeping rationality, which propels efficiency and growth, is itself irrational.”**_

We are literally drugging ourselves to get to the end of the day and **we destroy the planet we live in only to maximize profit.** The irrationality is profound, **we are supporting an infinite growth economic system in a finite system** encouraged by the degree to which society is able to deliver and produce goods.

**Capitalism is forced altruism**, we are forced to **do something that benefits others** (offer & demand) **or starve to death,** therefore it is impossible to get out of the status quo.

**‘Liberty’ can be a tool for domination**

We believe we have choices but in reality everything is the same, we are tricked into a fake belief of freedom.

_“Under the rule of a repressive whole, **liberty can be made into a powerful instrument of domination.** The range of choice open to the individual is not the decisive factor in determining the degree of human freedom, but what can be chosen and what is chosen by the individual. The criterion for free choice can never be an absolute one, but neither is it entirely relative. **Free election of masters does not abolish the masters or the slaves.”**_

**If every choice is the same, then democracy and communism are identical.**

_**“Democracy would appear to be the most efficient system of domination”**_

Are we truly free to choose our representatives, if out of dozens of political parties the winners are always one of two?

**Why the marxist revolution didn’t occur**

As shown by Hegel or Marx in order for change to occur, opposites must meet _“negation exists prior to the change itself”_. But **in contemporary society there is no longer a negation of the status quo**, we remain the same, we are persuaded, manipulated through confort. We can’t even imagine some different world (we can imagine the end of the world but not the end of capitalism)

_“Society's supreme promise is **an ever-more-comfortable life for an ever-growing number of people who**, in a strict sense, **cannot imagine a qualitatively different universe of discourse and action**, for the capacity to contain and manipulate subversive imagination and effort is an integral part of the given society.”_

**So although technology made us more comfortable it also brought new ways of control and oppression**

**Labor has changed**

_“The capitalist development has altered the structure and function **of these two classes** in such a way that they **no longer appear to be agents of historical transformation**. An overriding interest in the preservation and improvement of the institutional status quo unites the former antagonists in the most advanced areas of contemporary society.”_

* **Mechanization:** Unlike early stages of industrial society, there is no more physical pain from the worker. **Mental effort substituted muscular fatigue.**

_“**The proletarian** of the previous stages of capitalism was indeed the beast of burden, living in filth and poverty. Thus **** he **was the living denial of his society,** with an absolute need of subverting intolerable conditions of his existence **which is required in the beginnings of all revolutions against the basic social institutions.**_

_**In contrast, the organized worker** in the technological society lives this denial less conspicuously and **is being incorporated into the technological community of the administered population”**._

This is why the marxist revolution never occurred, **instead of revolution we got assimilation.** We became part of the machine.

* **Loyalty to the company**

_**“The workers even show a vested interest in the establishment**. The board of directors of any company can certainly rub their hands with joy when the unions agree to put off their salary demands because of the need for new investments_

_**Assimilation in needs and aspirations,** in the standard of living, in leisure activities, in politics **derives from an integration in the plant itself,** in the material process of production.”_

* **Bosses lose identity**

_“The capitalist bosses and owners are losing their identity as responsible agents; they are assuming the function of bureaucrats in a corporate machine. **The tangible source of exploitation disappears behind the facade of objective rationality. Hatred and frustration are deprived of their specific target,** and the technological veil conceals the reproduction of inequality and enslavement.'_

**One dimensional reality**

Advanced industrial society is not synonymous with materialism, spiritual thought is rising _“there is a great deal of ‘Worship together this week’, ‘Why not try God’, Zen, existentialism, etc. **But such modes of protest and transcendence are no longer contradictory to the status quo**  **and no longer negative**. They are rather the ceremonial part of practical behaviorism, its harmless negation, and are quickly digested by the status quo as part of its healthy diet._

_One-dimensional thought is systematically promoted by the makers of politics and their purveyors of mass information”_

**Repressive desublimation**

Freud used the term **sublimation for how we act when we want to do something but society doesn't approve of it**. Instead of being openly homosexual do something different to release that. So we lived in a repressive sublimation.

**Desublimation** is the opposite process, **we become free to do once again what we desire.**

For Marcuse **modern society t**hrough technology and liberal thinking **actually allows us to act out** our libidinal desires **but since we are able to that, it removes our awareness of oppression.**

We now buy a t-shirt of Che or a mask of Guy Fawkes thinking this goes against the system, when in reality it is part of it. We are free to protest but we already know it won't change anything, it will only feed the system (more police, more control, more masks sold)

**We are free to do as we want but what we want is part of the same whole.** So **we have lost this second dimension of thought** and just continue to perpetuate the system.

_“**This society turns everything it touches into a potential source of progress and of exploitation**, of drudgery and satisfaction, of freedom and of oppression. Sexuality is no exception.”_

**Art**

There used to be two cultures opposite to each other, **high vs mass culture.**

_**“Art contains the rationality of negation.** In its advanced positions, **it is called the Great Refusal—the protest against that which is.** The modes in which man and things are made to appear, to sing are modes of refuting, breaking their factual existence.”_

In **theaters** reality is broken, one goes to a place (an actual place) where one **transcends everyday existence.**

_“Now this essential gap between the arts and the order of the day is progressively closed by the advancing technological society. And with its closing, the Great Refusal is in turn refused._

_**The works of alienation are themselves incorporated** into this society **and become commercials—they sell, comfort, or excite”**_

Through progress and technology, **great works no longer stand in contradiction to the status quo,** everyone can access it, it has become part of life.

_“Bach as background music in the kitchen, Marx and **Freud in the drugstore”.**_

_“It is good that almost everyone can now have the fine arts at his fingertips, in this diffusion, however, they become cogs in a culture-machine which remakes their content.”_

Perhaps pop which was concurrent to Marcuse's showed that art still had the power to subvert, mocking high culture by using mass culture imagery.

_“Today's novel feature is **the flattening out of the antagonism between culture and social reality** through the obliteration of the opposition._

_**This liquidation of two-dimensional culture takes place not through the denial** and rejection of **the "cultural values," but through their wholesale incorporation into the established order,** through their reproduction and display on a massive scale.”_

**The ideals of great works and of humanity now are sold to the people,** they are used to fight for communism or other ideas that do not go against the current system (even when those ideas speak against capitalism)

_“Mass communications blend together harmoniously, and often unnoticeably, art, politics, religion, and philosophy with commercials; they bring these realms of culture to their common denominator—**the commodity form**. **The music of the soul is also the music of salesmanship.**_

_**Exchange value, not truth value counts**._

_As **the great words of freedom are pronounced by politicians**, on the screens and radios, **they turn into meaningless sounds which obtain meaning only in the context of propaganda,** business,_

_discipline, and relaxation. **This assimilation of the ideal with reality testifies to the extent to which the ideal has been surpassed**._

_**Higher culture becomes part of the material culture. In this transformation, it loses the greater part of its truth.”**_

An argument can be made if this high culture actually exists or not, but the case in point is that we are all left with values which are created and directed by the market.

Now Romeo, Don Juan, Hamlet have lost their subversive force, their truth. Everything is commercialized as the same in a nice package for everyone to ingest.

_“They find their home in everyday living, **intellectual culture becomes familiar goods and services.**_

_**Their massive reproduction and consumption and the absorbent power of society depletes the artistic dimension by assimilating its antagonistic contents**. In the realm of culture, the new totalitarianism manifests itself precisely in a harmonizing pluralism, where **the most contradictory works and truths peacefully coexist in indifference.”**_



**The Great refusal**

For Marcuse change is possible, although not likely

_“Every established society is confronted with the actuality or **possibility of a qualitatively different historical practice** which might destroy the existing institutional framework.”_

But such a project must follow 2 criteria:

1. **It must be in accordance with the real possibilities**, material and cultural.
2. **It must demonstrate its own higher rationality** by:
   1. **Preserving and improving the productive achievements of civilization**. No one is going to give up their current standard of life
   2. Being aware of the totalitarian system that currently exists and calling it out
   3. **Offering a greater chance for the pacification of existence**, a greater chance for the free development of human needs and faculties.

**We need a qualitative change**

**Technology for Marcuse is a social process**, it develops a set of truth values of their own which are good for the functioning of the apparatus, so technology creates our view of what is right or wrong.

To escape the cycle of irrationality we **must change the way in which we use and think about technology,** using technology in **the same way will only lead us to quantitative not quality changes.**

_"I am not advocating a romantic regression behind technology. On the contrary, I believe that **the potential liberating blessings of technology** and industrialization **will not even begin** to be real and visible **until capitalist industrialization and technology have been done away with."**_

Bigger, faster, less consuming cars are still cars, although with less pollution nuclear energy is still just extracting energy, so it follows the same paradigm.

**We need to revolutionize our use of it,** (_permaculture perhaps?_)

“_The established technology has become an instrument of destructive politics. **Qualitative change would transition to a higher stage of civilization if technics were designed and utilized for the pacification of the struggle for existence.”**_

**Subjects must change as well**

**Subjects** of totalitarian society **must develop new needs, true needs,** we have to identify the false needs **and redefine ourselves as a new historical subject.**

_“Self-determination will be real to the extent to which the masses have been dissolved into **individuals liberated from all propaganda, indoctrination,** and manipulation, **capable of knowing and comprehending the facts and of evaluating the alternatives**”_

In order to do this we must remove ourselves from society, refuse it, and understand who we really are.

We move away from _“the increasing irrationality of the whole; the need for aggressive expansion; the constant threat of war; intensified exploitation; dehumanization”_ into “_the planned utilization of resources for the satisfaction of vital needs with a minimum of toil, the transformation of leisure into free time, the pacification of the struggle for existence.”_

**How to fight the system**

_“The struggle for the solution has outgrown the traditional forms. The totalitarian tendencies of the one-dimensional society render **the traditional ways and means of protest ineffective; they** preserve the illusion of popular sovereignty. “_

For Marcuse one of the chances of change is peaceful protest, similar to Gandhi or Thoreau, he believes that _“The fact that **they start refusing to play the game may be the fact which marks the beginning of the end of a period.”**_

But in the end he is not optimistic, since the current system supports itself with a lot of power and resilience.

_“**Nothing indicates that it will be a good end. The economic and technical capabilities of the established societies are sufficiently vast to allow for adjustments and concessions to the underdog**, and their armed forces sufficiently trained and equipped to take care of emergency situations”_
