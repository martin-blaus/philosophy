# 1889 Martin Heidegger

### Bio <a href="#_gxx31ub4i2zz" id="_gxx31ub4i2zz"></a>

(1889 - 1976) was a German philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. He is best known for contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism and for being a Nazi.

#### A quick summary <a href="#_87zkpabj5y68" id="_87zkpabj5y68"></a>

Heidegger saw that philosophy had always looked at the world as something to be known, analytical systems trying to find the grounds of knowledge, and this is fine **but is this the totality of what being is?**

So Heidegger believed that we need to ask not what is Being but what is it like to be a human being, what is unique about our situation, what he calls a **Dasein** _(“being there”)_

He distinguishes 2 features:

1. **We are an ontological being**, a being that asks questions about his own existence (a rock or dog does not do this)
2. We are constantly **engaged in tasks we care (Sorge) about,** there's no human being that's just completely devoid of intentionality. We love, hate, ignore.. something

For Heidegger **we experience the world as he calls “ready at hand”** that is when we look at a hammer our initial experience of that hammer is not to analyze it and break it down into parts, no, **we experience it as equipment to be able to carry out certain tasks**. For Heidegger is not until the hammer breaks that we experience it as a being that we can get knowledge of (_“present at hand”)_

**Care structure**

This situation of Dasein is explained by Heidegger as the **care structure, which comes down to 3 things:**

1. **Facticity**

We don't pick who, when, where we are born, we are thrown into the world and this drastically influences the tasks that we are engaged in, hunting a Mammut or working in a factory, in a loving or broken family.

1. **Fallness:**

Is the non awareness of what it means to be. We can fall, specially with modern technology, into a set of tasks predetermined by how other people tell us to behave, we become a “they-self” _(“Das man”)_ instead of “Dasein”.

For Heidegger It's really easy to just fall into this role of being a modern technologically minded consumer waiting around for the next thing to consume, seeing yourself as separate from the world, separated from nature, chained to TV and the internet, instead of thinking for oneself. Is important that this is not an ethical doctrine, it is just one part of what it is to be a Dasein, we all eventually fall into tasks.

1. **Existenciallity**

We are a being that has possibilities, a rock cant decide to move to a different city…

So for Heidegger we have a choice: **we can live in authenticity or in inauthenticity.**

**An inauthentic person is someone who only embodies the first two parts of this care structure,**

they're thrown into existence in a particular time and place and they fall into tasks that other people around them tell them to do, never really considering the possibilities at their disposal about other ways to live their life, never considering the whole branch of existential reality. While **to be authentic is to consider all the possibilities** we have and to be asking ontological questions about being understanding **and being aware of the possibility of dying, of not being.**

This is far from a dichotomy, we can not be all the time in one state, **we all exist on different points along the spectrum of authenticity.** It’s not ethical, it's ontological. To be always authentic can lead to isolation from other people, conversations about the weather become meaningless (_idle talk)_ but to be always inauthentic can alienate us from ourselves and from nature.



#### Ontic and Ontological Inquiry <a href="#_jdn0i4gnc59h" id="_jdn0i4gnc59h"></a>

**Any philosophical inquiry about what it means to be is ontological.**

|                                   | **Philosophical** | **Scientific**       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Object of Inquiry                 | Being (Sein)      | Entity (Das Seiende) |
| Type of inquiry                   | ontological       | ontic                |
| Terms of inquiry                  | existentials      | Categories           |
| Status of occurrence in inquiry   | Factical          | Factual              |
| Type of self-awareness in inquiry | existential       | existentiell         |

Heidegger sets himself the task of recovering the question of the meaning of Being. In this context he draws two distinctions between different kinds of inquiry.The first, which is just another way of expressing the ontological difference, is between the ontical and the ontological, where the former is concerned with facts about entities and the latter is concerned with the meaning of Being.

The second distinction between different kinds of inquiry, drawn within the category of the ontological, is between regional ontology and fundamental ontology, where the former is concerned with the ontologies of particular domains, say biology or banking, and the latter is concerned with the a priori, transcendental conditions that make possible particular modes of Being

#### Dasein <a href="#_y4irf4skjeel" id="_y4irf4skjeel"></a>

it is likewise incorrect to translate Dasein as "human being," because "human being" refers to an actual entity or existent, with reference to its genus and species. To inquire about a "human being" would be to engage in an ontical inquiry. What Heidegger means by the term **Dasein is that entity which is capable of inquiring into its own Being**, and indeed, such an inquiry into its Being is what makes Dasein what it is.

_“Insofar as being constitutes what is asked about, and insofar as being means the being of beings, beings themselves turn out to be what is interrogated in the question of being..._

We are also entities

_“Everything we talk about, mean, and are related to is existent \[seiend] in one way or another. **What and how we ourselves are is also existent** . Being is found in thatness and whatness, reality, the objective presence of things, subsistence, validity, existence and in the "there is" \["es gibt"]._

#### 3-4. Why is ontology fundamental <a href="#_fi3193rv0p12" id="_fi3193rv0p12"></a>

Heidegger sees the priority or fundamental nature of the question of Being as exhibited both ontologically and ontically. The ontological priority of the question of Being is due to the fact that all science and forms of inquiry presuppose an "understanding of Being." The ontical priority consists of the fact that Dasein considers the question of its Being as an issue: i.e., as something about which Dasein-any self-conscious human being-is concerned.

At the risk of oversimplification, it might be summarized in this fashion:

To consider one's self as existing is to be aware of oneself as Dasein; and

1. Dasein is ontically prior because it exists
2. Dasein is ontologically prior because it can be questioned about its existence
3. Dasein is fundamentally-ontologically-prior because the questioning of its existence provides the foundation for all other inquiries

#### 5. The Analysis of Dasein <a href="#_phumdukjtbx5" id="_phumdukjtbx5"></a>

By keeping in mind the "everyday" self, we are, to an extent, allowing experience to speak out for itself. In this sense Heidegger here is an "empiricist. " He wishes to avoid describing Dasein by some narrow-minded or "hothouse" criteria that would reduce his analysis to a mere aspect of Dasein's Being. The whole point of the analysis is, after all, to study what it means to be, and certainly **one of the most frequent modes of our existence is that which one might call "everyday"**

_“Its own past-and that always means that of its "generation"-does not follow after Dasein but rather always already goes ahead of it.”_

#### 7. Heidegger's Phenomenology <a href="#_15n422iibeq1" id="_15n422iibeq1"></a>

In order to understand the whole (what it means to be), I need to know what it means to be in such and such a way; whereas to know what it means to be in such and such a way requires a knowledge of what it means to be at all.

But reason does not always reject circularity as negative, as long as it is not a vicious circle. For example: learning a language, where one discovers the context from the meaning of the words, and the meaning of the words from the context. (First we learn the words, how they sound in our language, then we keep learning the context and later we understand the meaning)

**Thus it is through the hermeneutic procedure that Heidegger carries out his analysis of Being,** and remains true to his two principles:

1. Let the facts speak for themselves
2. There are no such things as bare, uninterpreted facts.

By "phenomenology" Heidegger means that analysis by which the meaning of **the various ways in which we exist can be translated from the vague language** of everyday existence into the **understandable and explicit language of ontology** without destroying the way in which these meanings manifest themselves to us in our everyday lives.

Phenomenologically speaking, then**, there are no subjects and no objects; there is only the experience of the ongoing task (e.g., hammering).**

#### The world <a href="#_qfb0mqptqsd" id="_qfb0mqptqsd"></a>

**Contra Sartre**

When Sartre makes the claim that man's existence is prior to his essence he is merely taking the traditional metaphysical proposition that man has a nature or essence that precedes man's existence, and turning it around. The result is just another metaphysical claim, which has nothing to do with fundamental ontology.

Metaphysics makes claims about what we are; fundamental ontology examines how such claims are possible.

Thus Heidegger has disassociated himself from the existentialists (specifically Sartre), who tell us what man is like (e.g., that he is free, dreadful, lazy, or absurd), and, instead asks for an examination of those a priori ways of our Being that allow us to become aware of the metaphysical in the first place.

Heidegger's point is not to argue that man is characterized by dread, anxiety, and boredom; but rather, he wishes to point out **that one can significantly examine and inquire about existence, and that this ability of man's reason to reflect upon itself is its most amazing function.**

**Authenticity**

What Heidegger means by "authentic" is the awareness of one's own self; by " inauthentic," the awareness of the self merely as others see it, or perhaps to see one's self as having a meaning or essence that is prior to and hence "other" than one's existence

**Eigen \["own"] is the etymological base for eigentlich \["authentic"]**

The distinction between authentic and inauthentic is to the existential analytic exactly what the distinction between true and false propositions is to logic. That is, the distinction provides the thinker with a polarity or pair of opposites without which the discipline would deteriorate immediately into a random series of disconnected insights

Unfortunately, Heidegger is so skilled and artful in his analyses of the various ways we exist (both authentically and inauthentically) that his insights seem like revelations of extraordinary power in and of themselves. And as a consequence, **we are unfortunately led to believe that Heidegger's philosophy is about such insights. But this is entirely mistaken; for Heidegger, as a true philosopher, is unpacking these insights solely to isolate the question of the meaning of Being**

#### &#x20;<a href="#_gg1axp55538s" id="_gg1axp55538s"></a>

**Inauthenticity vs Authenticity**

Dasein is in the world with others, he gets lost and tends to understand the world according to common opinion, to think what he thinks, to do what he does. This is to be inauthentic, to be in they.

**Common views are shared,** not because we have verified them, but **just because they are common**. Instead of the original appropriation of the thing, the pure extension and the pure repetition of what has already been said is verified.

**Authenticity** is appropriation fundamentally in this sense: it appropriates the thing by directly relating to it. All this, although still vague, is nevertheless clearly attested by our common experience: speaking with knowledge of the facts can only be done when one has experienced in some direct way what is spoken; to "have an experience"

**Either I am not aware of the significance of Being, in which case I am determined in the actual by the persuasion of the "they"; or I myself resolutely determine my own Being**. In the authentic mode, Dasein is aware of its possible not-being. **This reveals its finitude. It is this finitude that provides the ontological foundation for Dasein's temporality, and hence one's awareness of time.**

To live in inauthenticity helps us avoid asking about our being, and in that sense helps us to avoid dread so it’s not bad in itself, the key is to seek some sort of balance. To not be 100% Tinelli nor 100% Schpenhauer

#### 12-13. To be in the world <a href="#_a46mdavpt8q5" id="_a46mdavpt8q5"></a>

The first a priori existential described in the analytic is being-in-the world, or perhaps better, to-be-in-the-world

World," in the sense of this existential, would be found in the self-reflective consciousness even of a rather primitive awareness, for which the limits of the world may well be the limits of a village or county

Heidegger undertakes two tasks in this chapter:

* To describe the ontological significance of what it means to-be-in-the-world
* To show that this existential is indeed a priori, and what this a priority entails.

**Scientifically, the fact that I am on planet earth is not a priori: it is learned only through experience. But the fact that, as Dasein, I must have a world to live in, to dwell in, to call my home, is a priori.**

_“It is true that being-in-the-world is an a priori necessary constitution of Dasein, but it is not at all sufficient to fully determine Dasein's being”_

A human being, then, is one who exists in such a way as to belong to this earth. It belongs. I cannot think of myself as existing simply as a space-time locus

To say that Being-in-the-world is a priori is also to say that one can successfully think about what it means to be in the world without having to rely solely on empirical evidence.

I can even be next to my friend but with my enemy. Since these determinations are neither spatial nor psychological, they precede such empirical or physical considerations and are hence a priori.

For what reason would one want to claim that "Being-in-the-world," in this ontological sense, is a priori? Consider the following. We, as human beings, have relationships both with things and with other human beings. **They are relationships of which we are aware and which change us. In this sense, inanimate objects do not have relationships**. Now suppose one is asked: What is the capacity by which one has such relationships?

**There must be some prior capacity within us that allows us to relate in the first place. This prior capacity is the a priori existential Being-in-the-world.** To-be-in-the-world is the ultimate presupposition of knowledge.

**Dwelling**

Is the distinctive manner in which Dasein is in the world. To dwell in a house is not merely to be inside it spatially in the sense just canvassed. Rather, **it is to belong there, to have a familiar place there**. It is in this sense that Dasein is (essentially) in the world.

**Subject and object is not the right view**

**The bases of epistemology are the knower and the known: but prior to the distinction between subject and object is the fact that the subject can relate to a known**. Knowledge does not occur in isolation from one's world of concern and environment. **It is never the case that I simply "know" something. Some bits of knowledge cause me happiness or sorrow; and even the** **seemingly "purely factual" bits of information satisfy my need for "objectivity."**

Heidegger points out that it is a natural error to see the world as made up of "objects," which are then known by a "subject".

**Then the relation of Subject-Object is not how the world is structured in fact the subject is affected a priori by objects**

If Heidegger is right, and Being-in-the-world is an a priori existential of Dasein, then certain philosophical "problems" are "solved". The mind-body problem, for example, and the problem of the reality of the external worlds are misleading abstractions from the necessary characteristics of Dasein's Being-in-the-world.



#### 14. Worldliness of the World <a href="#_hmrwh66d4goq" id="_hmrwh66d4goq"></a>

Heidegger explains that world can have 4 different meanings

1. _Used as an ontic concept and signifies the totality of beings which can be objectively present within the world._
2. _World functions as an ontological term and signifies the being of those beings named in 1. For example, when we speak of the "world" of the mathematician, we mean the region of all possible mathematical objects._
3. _Can be understood in an ontic sense as that "in which" a factical Dasein "lives" as Dasein. Here world has a pre-ontological, existentiell meaning._
4. _Finally, world designates the ontological and existential concept of worldliness._

#### 15-16. The World as Environment <a href="#_x2uaz2z5k9pb" id="_x2uaz2z5k9pb"></a>

We can relate to the world in 2 ways:

* **Ready-at-hand** (zuhanden)
* **Present-at-hand** (vorhanden)

**The first is our primordial relationship with the world is to use it: i.e., the world for us is available-"ready-at-hand".** To think of the world as made up of things independent of their function or use.

_“For example, hammering with the hammer, neither grasps these beings thematically as occurring things, nor does such using even know the structure of useful things as such. **Hammering does not just have a knowledge of the useful character of the hammer; rather, it has appropriated this utensil in the most adequate way possible**. In such useful dealings, taking care subordinates itself to the in-order-to constitutive for the particular utensil in our dealings; **the less we just stare at the thing called hammer, the more we take hold of it and use it**, the more original our relation to it becomes and the more undisguisedly it is encountered as what it is, as a useful thing. **The act of hammering itself discovers the specific "handiness"** of the hammer.”_

**Science sees the world as present-at-hand**, interested in the object only as an object. **To see the world as present-at-hand is merely one mode of Dasein's relating to its world**. To be sure, the attitude of mind by which one sees the objects in the world as present-at-hand is undoubtedly the best attitude for science; but it is not necessarily the best attitude for philosophy

To use something and to think about something as a thing are two totally different activities of mind, neither of which exhausts one's awareness of the world

**From ready-at-hand to present-at-hand**

**A man can relate to a hammer in two ways**. He can i**nvolve himself with it as a tool by using it to drive nails into a wooden shelf**. On the other hand, **he can also reflect upon the hammer as an object and consider its physical and even metaphysical properties.** Heidegger calls the first mode of relationship ready-at-hand; and he is strongly persuaded that this mode is indeed the primordial and most immediate manner in which Dasein relates to the world. The second mode of relationship is called present-at-hand; it is a derived mode, and hence can only occur

But **how is it that a man changes from his use of the hammer to the reflection about it?** In the first place, **Heidegger insists that the two modes, praxis and theory, must not be seen as totally independent of each other**

**Example between a heart surgeon and a biologist**

The realm of the surgeon is praxis and the biologist theory, both men are directly concerned with the human heart. In fact, one can picture these two men with an actual human heart directly in front of them**. For the surgeon, what the heart is as an entity present-at-hand is not even considered**. As the surgeon works over his patient he deliberates over the heart only in terms of the ready-at-hand, only in the realm of praxis. **But the biologist sees the same thing just as presence-at-hand. The theorist sees an entity with properties.**

The point is that for the two men, the heart is different, its Being is different. **The theorist does not involve himself with the if . . . then . . . deliberations of the ready-at-hand**. He views the heart, and indeed the whole world at that moment as an aggregate of entities present-at-hand. The particularity of this heart at this time in this place ceases to be significant.

**The roots of science stem from authentic existence.**

**To see the world as made up of entities present-at-hand is a way of understanding Being;** and **the more precisely this view of the world relates to and takes its guidance from an understanding of Being, the more successful that way of "seeing" the world is.**

**Mathematical physics, for example, is successful not because of its rigid adherence to "facts"** (since there are no such things as plain facts), **but because of its development along the lines of mathematical projection.**

If the proper understanding of scientific activity is to see science as a projection along the lines of the understanding of Being, then **the roots of science stem from authentic existence.** Heidegger, then, by no means wishes to lower the status of science, as some might feel, for science belongs to the general range of authentic understanding. What Heidegger does wish to lower, however, are mistaken views as to what constitutes the methodology of science (the positivists), and those who take technique as a mode of life-i.e., those for whom the projection of possibilities beyond the actual event is not significant.

**The scientific projection of nature as present-at-hand is a form of thematizing**. Thematizing is the total projection of a subject matter in terms of one's understanding of Being. **Being and Time is a thematic inquiry. Science also is thematic in character.**

#### 24. The Spatiality of Dasein and Space <a href="#_v0ph8zn218sq" id="_v0ph8zn218sq"></a>

_**Space is neither in the subject nor is the world in space.** Rather, space is "in'' the world since the being-in-the-world constitutive for Dasein has disclosed space. Space is not in the subject, nor does that subject observe the world "as if'' it were in space. Rather **Dasein, is spatial in a primordial sense**. And because Dasein is spatial in the way described, **space shows itself as a priori.**_

#### 25-27. The who of dasein <a href="#_ph8fqxw8gelj" id="_ph8fqxw8gelj"></a>

**Heidegger's phenomenological approach**

This brief sketch of the argumentation that Heidegger is going to follow in the subsequent sections emphasizes the importance of the present discussion of the self. One might note that Heidegger's methodology is phenomenological rather than logical: he does not begin with an analysis of freedom and time, and from this deduce the modes of authenticity and inauthenticity. Rather, **he begins from our phenomenological and prior comprehension of the modes of our self-understanding, and from this analysis he develops the ontological base.**



**There is no naked ‘I’**

One of the main tenets of Heidegger's analysis is his insistence that one cannot begin the analysis of the self from a naked and lonely "I," or pure consciousness. Heidegger argues that the primordially given "I" or self is always and already part of the world; and indeed, a world in which other persons are likewise given.

The highly abstract and purely rational "ego" of the Cartesian metaphysics is a fiction. Neither Husserl's "bracketing" nor Descartes's "doubting" can in principle succeed if the total given is a consciousness or a self already involved with the world.

**In my everyday self, I am not I**. This does not mean that I become somebody other than myself, for as Heidegger cleverly puts it: _"\[Others] are those from whom, for the most part, one does not distinguish oneself-those among whom one is too."_ What, then, does Heidegger mean by saying that in everyday mode, I am not I? The answer to this lies in the consideration of the distinction between the authentic and the inauthentic modes of the self. **I do not lose my "I" to some other Dasein; instead I lose it to the "they," which is a mode of the self.**

**To be with others (Being-with)**

To say that Being-with (or to-be-with) is an a priori existential of Dasein means that one cannot be a self unless it is within one's possibilities to relate in a unique way to other Daseins. **Hence to be Dasein at all means to-be-with**. But this further implies that **others are not completely external-i.e., to be with others is a possibility of every self. It is not, therefore, a non-self characteristic, but an existential of the self.**

_“Even ‘taking care’ of food and clothing, and the nursing of the sick body is a concern. But we understand this expression in a way which corresponds to our use of taking care as a term for an existential. For example, "welfare work" as a factical social institution, is based on the constitution of Dasein as being with. Its factical urgency is motivated by the fact that Dasein initially and, for the most part, lives in the deficient modes of concern. Being for-, against-, and without-one-another, passing-one-another-by, not mattering-to-one-another, are possible ways of concern”_

**Other Daseins use the world as equipment as well.** It is through the analysis of Dasein's use of the world as equipment that we come across the realization that there are other Daseins who also use the world as equipment.

**The world as equipment is for the sake of. Of what? Not always myself. Therefore, there must be some other Dasein that this piece of equipment serves.** Hence other Daseins are conceived, not as pieces of equipment, but rather as that for which something is a piece of equipment. **This demands that my ontology relating to another Dasein is basically different from my relationship to the world as equipment.** The a priori possibility of such a relationship is called **Being-with.**

_“To be sure, being-toward-others is ontologically different from being toward objectively present things. T**he "other" being itself has the kind of being of Dasein.** Thus, in being with and toward others**, there is a relation of being from Dasein to Dasein**. But, one would like to say, this relation is after all already constitutive for one's own Dasein, which has an understanding of its own being and is thus related to Dasein. The relation of being to others then becomes a projection of one's own being toward oneself "into another." **The other is a duplicate of the self.”**_

#### Chapter IV - Understanding <a href="#_hmcm83h3og54" id="_hmcm83h3og54"></a>

Authentic existence, by definition, is being aware of the meaning of existence; inauthentic existence is being unaware of the meaning of existence. The question that must be asked now is, How is such awareness possible?

**The problem – Actual and Possible**

**How is it that I can exist in such a way as to have possibilities?** and, how does this differ from

my existing in such a way as to be actual? It is important to realize that I am not asking merely a logical or linguistic question. I am, instead, asking two closely related questions**: How is my actuality meaningful to me? and, how is my having possibilities meaningful to me?**

In short, **our lives are meaningful not only because of what is, but also because of what might have been and what might be.**

Now since the human person lives a life in which both possibility and actuality are important (and indeed, it is a life in which the various moments and situations at one time emphasize the actual, and at another the possible), it seems obvious that the only truly complete philosophy would be one in which both the actual and the possible are duly accounted for.

I do not simply have a possible life as well as an actual life; rather**, I have one life in which both the actual and the possible are significant**. Hence it is not enough merely to describe two totally distinct and separate functions; I must, indeed, also show how they relate.

Heidegger's approach to this problem is consistent with his description of his thought as "phenomenological" If we are going to avoid excluding either mode (actual or possible), we must begin our analysis by letting these modes reveal themselves in the fullness of their own significance. **Heidegger insists that the two modes are equally primordial; and that means that neither can be descriptively accounted for by the other-i**.e., the one cannot be "reduced" to the terms of the other. **Only after such descriptions can any attempt be made to unify the two under a more general concept. This ultimate existential is going to be called "care" (Sorge)**; but we cannot begin with care if we proceed phenomenologically. Care as the ultimate existential must be revealed.

There 2 ways of describing Being:

* **State-of-mind** (Befindlichkeit): In which one's **actuality is revealed.**
* **Understanding** (Verstehen): In which one's **possibilities are revealed.**

For Heidegger, **the principle of possibility is prior to and more meaningful than actuality**



**29. State of mind (mode of the actual)**

State-of-mind to Heidegger means the **a priori existential by which Dasein has its moods,** Dasein’s mode of awareness of the actual

**I realize that I find myself in a world without having first asked to be in it. I did not choose to be born. Nor did I choose to be in the circumstances under which I was born.** If I were of a truculent nature I might even complain that it hardly seems fair that I was thrown into this world and this particular situation totally without my preferences being heard. **But thrown I was.**

**Three characteristics of this existential:**

1. The disclosure of our "thrownness", our being is to some extent determined by conditions and circumstances beyond our control.
2. The disclosure of Being-in-the-world-as-a-whole.
3. The disclosure that what Dasein encounters in the world matters to Dasein

**State-of-mind discloses or reveals the fact that Dasein is in the world; but not why or for what purpose.** Hence there is always something unknown about one's actual state in the world

**Fate**

**Our moods do reveal a great deal about our attitude toward the inevitable in life,** like how we react against “fate” when we don’t get in life what we think we deserve

If we cannot control our fates, then how are we to make sense of them? The truth, of course, is that **we do not and cannot know why one man is blessed and another cursed.**

We simply do not know why fortune smiles on the favored and frowns on the wretched. But, though we cannot know the causes or the why of such things, we can and must think about what they mean. In order to do this, **we must understand that what it means for us to exist is intelligible only by the recognition that we are both fated and free; or, to be more exact, we are free as fated beings and are fated as free beings.**

What is peculiar about moods is that, even as they account in part for how we fit into the world, **we simply cannot make a certain mood happen**. No matter how self-controlled I am, I cannot simply decide one day to be in a good mood or a bad mood. **Moods by definition are independent of my selection and control.**

What makes our half-determined, half-free existence intelligible is the realization that these modes are a priori, that is, they are simply not accountable by any other principle or force; **rather they are the fundamental givens by which we must make sense of our being in the world, so state-of-mind is the basis for the world mattering to Dasein.**

**30. Fear**

Fearing "has already disclosed the world, in that out of it something like the fearsome may come close. "Actual occurrences of fear, then, reveal what has always been there-i.e., a way of Being in the world so that a part of it can threaten us.”

Heidegger, then, is not giving a psychological account of fear, he’s asking **How is fearing possible? Fearing is possible because my existence is determined by a concern for what is (state-of-mind), and what is a mode of my existence.**

#### 31. Understanding (mode of the possible) <a href="#_bu7upr7k2pgz" id="_bu7upr7k2pgz"></a>

_“In understanding as an existential, the thing we are able to do is not a what, but Being as existing. The mode of being of Dasein as a potentiality of being lies existentially in understanding._“

Heidegger claims that **understanding is an existential.** Hence as we have seen, **this means that it is a priori and that it reveals the manner in which Dasein exists.**

How, then, does understanding reveal to Dasein its mode of existing? By making Dasein able-to-be. **As a human existent, my ability to be is something of which I am aware**. Hence it is not merely the case that I am a thing present-at-hand in the universe. **My own existence is a possibility stretching out before me, about which I concern myself, and over which I have some control.** Heidegger describes this as a **projection**.

“_As an existential, pos**sibility does not refer to a free-floating potentiality of being in the sense of the "liberty of indifference.** As essentially attuned, **Dasein has always already got itself into definite possibilities...** Dasein is the possibility of being free for its ownmost potentiality of being. Being possible is transparent for it in various possible ways and degrees.”_

_“Only because Dasein is there, understandingly can it go astray and fail to recognize itself. **And since understanding is attuned and attunement is existentially surrendered to thrownness, Dasein has always already gone astray and failed to recognize itself.** In its potentiality of being, it is thus delivered over to the possibility of first finding itself again in its possibilities.”_

Heidegger means that one first relates to the world in terms of seeing the world as something to use. This means that **Dasein sees the world for Dasein's own sake.**

The world is significant as it presents itself to my projects, my plans, my possibilities. Even **to see the world not as ready-at-hand but as present-at-hand is likewise for my sake**; such an attitude is assumed for a reason-i.e., to increase my knowledge.

But if Heidegger's analysis of the world is correct, then the world presents itself to us not as simple, actual things; but as possible ways of service. **The world is my project-it is, in one sense, always a kind of future world, yet to be realized.**

**Understanding operates, then, by projecting before Dasein its possibilities. It can do this because Dasein is such as to have possibilities.** The world, then, presents to me not so many actualities as possibilities.

**Rather than being free because I consider possibilities, I consider possibilities because I am free.**

**Logic**

**Logic is what has only 1 possibility, what is necessary.** For example understanding in the principle of non contradiction

How do I know, for example, that proposition p is not inconsistent with proposition q? If I can think p and think q together without any violation of reasoning, I say p is not inconsistent with q. **"If I can . . . " means that the very determination of the logical principle is based upon my having possibilities**. This may be made clearer in a more concrete example. Suppose, in order to illustrate the meaning of the terms "contingent" and "necessary" to an undergraduate class, I ask them the question: "Is it necessary that this wall be painted blue? " The answer, of course, is no. It could be painted green. Thus, we say the color of the wall is a contingent fact, not a necessary one. But how do we know that the blueness of the wall is not necessary?

Because I can think of it otherwise. It is in fact blue, but it need not be blue, because I am capable of thinking in a way that is not determined by what is the case. On the other hand, I argue that a circle necessarily has 360 degrees because I cannot think of a circle in any other way except that it has so many degrees. **The limits of what I can do determine the laws of logic. The term "can," indeed, means "to be able." In fact, the analysis of how reasoning operates logically shows that the ability of what I can do with my cognitive powers comes before the determination of the principles of reasoning. To be sure, such "abilities" do not occur without cognitive awareness.**

**Mind body problem is solved**

For Heidegger, possibilities become available to the inquirer neither through pure cognition nor through experience. Rather, they become available to the inquirer through the existence-structure of the inquirer himself. Possibility is not something experienced (for we experience only actualities), nor is it something purely thought (for possibility is not the result of thinking since thinking itself presupposes it). **Rather, possibility is part and parcel of the very existence of one who thinks.**

The always difficult problem of how the mind relates to the body, or of how ideas and ideals relate to facts, has now been grounded in existence.

**Summary**

1. The cognitive faculties of understanding are based on and are secondary to the existential aspects.
2. **Understanding operates through a projection of possibilitie**s. What is projected is the entire range of Dasein's own possibilities.
3. **I can think of possibilities because I have possibilities.**
4. Dasein is always factically more than what Dasein factually is. **(I am more in terms of my possibilities than in terms of my actuality.)**
5. One of the chief results of this analysis is a **much closer relationship between thinking and being.**

**32. Understanding as interpretation**

_“ When inner worldly beings are discovered along with the being of Dasein, that is, when they become intelligible, we say that they have meaning \[Sinn].”_

Understanding functions through the projection of possibilities. **In interpretation, understanding works out this projection.** Understanding projects, interpretation works out.

Heidegger's account of interpretation is an account that focuses on the ability of the mind to make explicit and to reveal what is somehow already within one's experience.

**There are three basic considerations of interpretation all of which see the world ready-at-hand not present-at-hand:**

* **The as-structure**: Pointing out the purpose or usability of that thing. One does not take an object abstractly and uncaringly I simply make clear what is already there
* **The fore-structure**: Interprets the phenomena. Directs our attention to the specific problem area so the as-structure will be made explicit.
* **Meaning**: is **understanding becoming aware of the as-structure.** Dasein's relating to the world as available for its use (the world as ready-at-hand)**. For something to have meaning, then, means for something to be made explicit in terms of its service toward Dasein.**

Heidegger shows that meaning and interpretation take their significance in readiness-at-hand because he wants to argue that **at no time does Dasein understand the meaning of something independently of Dasein's existential awareness**. If by "objective meaning" one means a significance totally without any subjective, existential influences, then Heidegger would deny the possibility of such meaning

_“**Meaning is an existential of Dasein, not a property that is attached to beings,** which lies "behind" them or floats somewhere as a "realm between." **Only Dasein "has" meaning** in that the disclosedness of being-in-the-world can be "fulfilled" through the beings discoverable in it. **Thus only Dasein can be meaningful or meaningless**.”_

**33. Assertion and interpretation**

_“All interpretation is grounded in understanding. What is articulated as such in interpretation and is prefigured as articulable in understanding in general is meaning”_

**When I "assert" that the hammer is too heavy,** I'm not talking about my concept of the hammer, theoretically conceived; but rather, **I** **am talking about the hammer as I use it**, which, as we have seen, is the primary meaning of the hammer

**34. Language**

**Who is saying it, under what conditions, to whom it is said, the personality of the hearer as well as the speaker, all together go to make up what really happens in such a circumstance**. An accurate account of what was communicated between the speaker and the hearer must be based upon the existential situation rather than the purely linguistic or even purely logical situation**. Heidegger maintains, then, that the basis of language is neither grammar nor logic, but talk.**

If Heidegger is correct, then any purely formal analysis of language is in principle inadequate.

The order is:

1. **Talk:** The existential ground
2. **Language**: It’s the expression of talk, but language is ready-at-hand, it is used.
3. **Sentences:** are merely the formal expression of the existential manner through which Dasein relates to the world, and as such, sentences are derived and do not carry with them the foundation of human communication.

Heidegger's main point is that **truth does not reside in the purely formal or logical characteristics of propositions.**

**In conclusion**

We have seen that Dasein has significance both in terms of its actually "thrown" state and in terms of its possibilities. **Dasein is never simply actual or simply possible, but both possibility and actuality are equally significant to it. Its awareness of it in terms of these two ways are state-of-mind and understanding. The significance of both modes can be made explicit in language, the basis of which is existential talking.**

#### 35-38. Everydayness and falling <a href="#_i0sikbef3rnm" id="_i0sikbef3rnm"></a>

**Fallenness:** Is the non awareness of what it means to be.

It can be seen in 3 different forms (but not only)

**Idle talk**

Is like this conversation; though idle talk also refers to those modes of expression that are less obviously inauthentic: the chattering enthusiasm of those who find everything in the world "interesting" but never relevant. **Is the manner in which the inauthentic they-self articulates** its subtle smoke screens, which hide the genuine skill of language to expose the workings of what it means to be.

**Curiosity**

People whose attitude toward the world is one of bemused, curious, but ultimately indifferent observation can be said to be inauthentic in their relationship to the world

**We all are acquainted with people who accept all human events with equal significance**. In fact, it is sometimes even seen as a praiseworthy attribute to enjoy a second-rate work of art as much as a great one. This is "democracy" pushed to its most ludicrous extreme. This is essentially inauthentic.

**Ambiguity**

The chief characteristic of this mode is tranquillity. By saying this, Heidegger is not suggesting that one should be very dynamic or intensely excited in all of one's actions. Nor is he denying the importance of scientific objectivity. **But he is pointing out that when one interprets one's self as a purely cognitive and passive calculator, such a mode is inauthentic**

**The man who knows only "all the facts" is out of touch with the most central question** (What does it mean to be?) and hence is inauthentic.

**Fallness is not related to morality, it’s just an insight into the human condition**

Heidegger's account of the inauthentic modes of the self-i.e., the they-self-does not suggest that such a mode should be seen as something evil, which is to be overcome at all costs.

**Heidegger is not "moralizing".** Such **inauthentic moments reveal the structure of how one avoids the confrontation of the ontological question.**

The psychological benefits one may receive from reading this section may be helpful, but they must be seen as incidental to the main task

#### Chapter V - Care, reality and truth <a href="#_b4ya5o842t4y" id="_b4ya5o842t4y"></a>

Heidegger wants to establish a single unifying existential that lies at the basis of all others since

_“if there were no unitary existential, there could be no basis for going beyond the simple enumeration of existentials, and there would then be no possible link between the mere analysis of everydayness and the ontological ground that lies at its foundation.”_

**40. Dread**

Dread is interpreted both as a turning away from, and as a confrontation of, the self **our turning away reveals that from which we are turning away.** For example: “I do not turn away from my commitment to my friend because I don't know my obligations, but because I do know them.”

The interest in dread is that it does seem to remove us from our concern about the things that are happening around us, and in doing so allows us to reflect upon our own stark and **terrifying existence. In that it does focus upon existence, its analysis is invaluable for the inquiry into what it means to be.**

**For Heidegger what we dread is not something specific**, **it’s actually nothingness, to be nothing.** **It is not the experience of dying,** or the pain of having life wrenched from one's body. **These things are indeed "experienced," and can be "feared**".

**To be aware of being able not to be is something quite different.**

_“Thus neither does anxiety "see" a definite “'there” and''over here" from which what is threatening approaches. **The fact that what is threatening is nowhere characterizes what anxiety is about.**  **Anxiety "does not know" what it is anxious about**. But "nowhere" does not mean nothing; rather, region in general lies therein, and disclosedness of the world in general for essentially spatial being-in. **Therefore, what is threatening cannot come closer from a definite direction within nearness, it is already "there" and yet nowhere**. **It is so near that it is oppressive and takes away one's breath-and yet it is nowhere.”**_

Then that existential which makes us aware of nothingness is dread. **Dread is a state-of-mind**. This means that **we are made aware of what is** **not of what could be** (mode of understanding) . It reveals to us how we are in a world. And how is it that we are in a world? **We are thrown into a world. Dread brings us face to face with this thrownness**

**It is the uncanny awareness of the self as free to be either authentic or inauthentic**, but dread is merely an example.

**41-42. Care (Sorge) as the being of Dasein**

The analysis of fallenness has shown that Dasein, in the mode of falling, turns away from itself through interest and care in the inauthentic world of the they-self. Thus indirectly, though nevertheless surely, fallenness exposes Dasein's concern for itself. But it has exposed all of this through the recognition that turning away from the self is a kind of involvement in the they-self. **That is, it is a kind of caring.**

The analysis of Dasein has, to be sure, already been prepared. We can summarize the existentials as

**Existentials:**

* **Relate to entities other than self:**
  * **Being-in-the-world**
  * **Being-with**
* **Relate to the self:**
  * **State-of-mind: what one is (the actual)**

Projects before itself its own possibilities. Dasein is aware of its being able to be. It not only has possibilities; it is its possibilities. Through the awareness of my own possibilities, I can project before myself the choices of authenticity

*
  * **Understanding: what one can be (possible)**

This Being-ahead-of-itself is not a random and arbitrary freedom to live any way one wants to live, however. **My world has limits**. In fact, to a large extent, there is much about what I am that cannot be overcome. One is already thrown into a world in which one has little to say or to determine. All this means is that I not only have possibilities, but that I am also aware of the limits of my actuality.

*
  * **Fallenness**

How one hides in inauthentic existence Dasein is generally occupied with its daily, inauthentic events. This is what fallenness means but it is not an occasional attitude.

* **Primordial:**
  * **Care** (**about→** things **or for→** people)

Care is indeed primordial and that it cannot be reduced to such phenomena as willing, wishing, urging, etc. Rather, he shows that these phenomena are based in care.

**43. Problem of reality**

Descartes uses the example of a ball of wax to show what he means by the difference between substance and accident. The essence or the substance of the wax is reduced to pure extension. Descartes's view of material substances is purely present-at-hand: substances are entities that are seen in their simple thinghood-i.e., they take up space and thereby constitute the furniture of the universe.

But to Heidegger, to attribute purely abstract characteristics to an object and to the world in general is just as much a subjective imposition upon the world as is the child's determination that the cord is a toy. The ball of wax is not an extended substance with the accidents of softness and smoothness added on to it. **A ball of wax is something used to seal letters or make candles. Such a description is telling us about the world.**

As a part of the world I live in, that piece of wax is equipment for making candles or sealing envelopes. Such an interpretation tells me about the world as I am in it; Descartes's interpretation merely tells me how I can think about it.

His strongest argument is that presence-at-hand, like readiness-at-hand, is a mode of how we relate to the world, and hence cannot be seen as the simple element that exhausts what is in the world. The normal and traditional meaning of the term "reality" is what Heidegger has called present-at-hand but this is missing the point, Kant argued that the concept of permanence could not come from within, so there had to be a world existing "outside" of us. Heidegger's objection to this argument is not so much that there are logical errors in the refutation of idealism, but that the very fact that Kant even tried to "prove" the existence of the external world belies his acceptance of an isolated subject, which he inherited from Descartes. The whole point is, of course, **that the existential analytic has shown that there is no such thing as the isolated or pure subject or ego. Dasein already has a world by its very constitution. To "prove" the existence of an external world is to overlook the a priori nature of Being-in-the-world.**

Reality can be understood only in terms of the world. The world, of course, has already been shown to exist as a mode of Dasein, whose primordial existential is care. Thus, to direct one's attention to reality is simply to exercise a particular mode of caring. Reality, then, is based on care.

**Thus rocks and trees do not depend on man for their location and occurrence in the universe, but reality, which is merely a mode of man's interpretation of the world, does depend on man's existence.**

**He is simply pointing out that to know what it means to be requires a self-conscious entity capable of this awareness.**

#### 44. Heidegger’s theory of truth <a href="#_a6lviajl0hz7" id="_a6lviajl0hz7"></a>

In Heidegger's approach to truth he examines what happens in an event in which truth occurs. But to understand truth in this way already has enormous consequences, for **truth is no longer a mere relation between the subject-knower and the object-known but rather something that happens**. And what happens is that **the meaning of the event is revealed to us**. For something to be true is for it to be revealed. Truth is not seen; it is shown.

**3 levels of truth from the lowest to the highest**, but one is only possible due to the next one

* **Propositional**: This is the traditional understanding in which truth is seen as the correct correspondence between a proposition and what is the case: "The picture is askew on the wall" is true because the picture actually is askew on the wall
* **Ontic**: This is what is meant by the picture announcing itself or revealing itself as askew; this is the first level of unconcealedness or manifestness.
* **Ontological**: This is the highest-or "truest"-sense of truth, in which **what it means to be is revealed**. In the present example, one must first be able to exist so as to let the askewness matter and be noticed; thus in revealing its askewness the crooked picture also reveals to us something about who we are, i.e., our own meaning.

If Heidegger is right, propositional truth is a derived and limited kind of truth. Truth, he claims, in the first and most real sense, refers not to objects but to Dasein.

This means that as an entity that uncovers (as an entity "in truth" ) Dasein reveals itself as factical-limited by what actually is; as existential projection-open to its own possibilities; and as fallen-closed off to these possibilities by its they-involvement. **For the most part, Dasein does not expose itself; it remains hidden. As hidden it is in untruth.**

Heidegger points out that the very etymology of the Greek **aletheia** (‘what is not hidden’) shows that truth is a kind of violation or robbery of what is normally the case.

#### &#x20;<a href="#_nnyl3ok3dzev" id="_nnyl3ok3dzev"></a>

#### 44. The Being of Truth <a href="#_g3q4z7c05ng8" id="_g3q4z7c05ng8"></a>

Truth is an existential of Dasein. Truth, then, is a characteristic of Dasein, and as such does not exist independent of it. Heidegger is not saying that Dasein determines what is the truth. Nor does Dasein have the power of arbitrarily assigning truth values. But since truth is defined as unhiddenness based on disclosure, and since only Dasein discloses, truth can exist only in the mode of Dasein's existence.

By **seeing truth as essentially a characteristic of Dasein coming to be aware of itself through its disclosure of itself in its limitations, possibilities, and tendencies toward concealment** (i.e., its state-of-mind, its understanding, and its fallenness), the self-reflective activity of hermeneutic interpretation is thereby rendered as possibly true, and not merely emotively exciting. For this reason the discussion of truth has come at the end of the preparatory analytic; for the whole analysis has finally crystallized in the awareness that the interpretation of the existential self is the very foundation of truth.

**An example (split in awarnesses)**

Suppose a young man has decided to inquire about his own nature as he reflects upon himself

**He becomes aware of his facticity:**

He becomes aware that his existence is in one sense limited by forces beyond his comprehension and control. He experiences the utter impotence at being unable to determine his origin, his color, his sex, race, native language, and social status.

**He becomes aware of his existentiality:**

But he is a creative and imaginative thinker, and his self-examination also reveals his rich and almost infinite variety of possibilities. He realizes that to a great extent his whole authenticity is his own affair. He becomes aware of his potentiality to be.

**He becomes aware of his fallenness**

His analysis does not stop there. He also becomes aware that the analysis itself was possible only through a violence done to his own everyday existence. He realized that there was an almost natural tendency in himself to avoid such investigations, to yield to the comfortable persuasion of the chatter of the they-self.

He feels deeply within himself that such awareness is not arbitrary; and that if anything can be said to be true, his awareness of his existential structure is true. He feels it is true not only because the issue is so important to him, but also because he himself has experienced the actual stripping of himself, as it were, before his own relentless inquiry. He was aware of himself being exposed, being disclosed. Surely, he might say, that is what truth itself means. To be disclosed. To reveal oneself as one exists.

**Summary of part V**

We have seen the critical distinction between presence-at-hand and readiness-at-hand resulting from the first existential awareness: that **one is always already in a world, and that this world does not primarily consist of pure substances, but of equipment ready to use for the sake of Dasein**. We have also seen, in terms of the second group of existentials, that **the self has two modes, the authentic and the inauthentic**. Upon reflection of the self it became obvious that **the self discloses itself in three major ways: through state-of-mind, understanding, and fallenness.** This threefold structure of disclosure manifested itself in a single, comprehensive existential called care. And finally, **truth was seen as unhiddenness**, an interpretation that rendered the entire analysis open to the claims of truth. All of this, however, was preparatory. **The analysis has laid the groundwork for the ontological account; it** is now possible to show that the structure of care is actually temporality.

**Chapter VI – Death**

The shift is from an account of the purely existential ways in which Dasein manifests its occupation of the world, to the authentic and ontological awareness of itself that comes from an awareness of the meaning of death

**Heidegger will go over 3 major subject matters: death, authentic existence, and time.**

Death, of course, does reveal the terrible temporality of our existence. Because death focuses upon our own existence rather than upon the inauthentic they-self (for the they-self does not die), it becomes the ground for authentic existence.

The "everyday" perspective of the world and the self, basically inauthentic, is characterized by avoiding the ontological question. One's daily life is so imbued with trivial distractions that one cannot ask What does it mean to be?

**The first aspect of death that is imposed on us is its insurmountable character.** Death, unlike the other possibilities of existence, is not only a possibility from which Dasein cannot escape, but, in the face of all other possibilities, it is characterized by the fact that beyond it nothing else it is possible to Dasein as being in the world. **Death is the possibility of the impossibility** of any other possibility, "the possibility of the pure and simple impossibility of Dasein"; Death is the most proper possibility of Dasein: this can be seen attested by the fact that all they die, that is, that possibility is co-essential to Dasein; but the root of the empirical fact that everyone dies is the circumstance that death is the most appropriate possibility of Dasein insofar as it affects it in its very being, in its very essence as a project, while any other possibility is situated within of the project itself as its way of determining

**Theory of death**

**Every man dies his own death**. It cannot be shared or be taken over by someone else.

The very uniqueness of death-for in spite of its rather frequent occurrence it comes only once for each person-makes it an invaluable object for inquiry

That the scope of life is determined by death is made evident even in the most trivial of expressions: "Before I die I'm going to visit the Hebrides!” **Death is seen as the ultimate evaluator, the terminal point of a career, the end of a life**: that which neatly ties up all the loose ends of a personality and binds it up in a nice and sterile package.

Perhaps the love of life, or the comfortable tranquillity of self-deception, keeps us from truly realizing what it means to be something that will one day cease to be.

What is important in this analysis is not how one actually feels at the moment of death, but what impending death can mean to one in the fullness of one's life. The fact that I, as a healthy and secure individual with a good many years before me, can nevertheless realize that I will one day die provides me with sufficient speculative material to accomplish these insights.



**The problem: Can death be grasped?**

Epicurus had argued that death could never confront us, because as long as we are, death isn't; and as soon as death is, we aren't and as long as death is out of our grasp, so too is our ability to see the end or totality of human existence

If only death can give us a total perspective, how can death, as an existential, be realized? Heidegger puts it in these terms: As long as Dasein is, it is not-yet (not all of its possibilities are fully realized). Yet as soon as Dasein dies, it is no more (as Dasein anyway).

The distinction that Heidegger makes to allow this completeness to be available for inquiry is this: One need not be at an end to realize that one is going to end.

**Being-toward-death**

What is contained in the existential is not the actual experience of dying, nor a morbid concentration on the fact that one day I shall die. What the term signifies is the existential awareness of the possibility of ceasing to be: a real awareness, then, that I am going to die.



**Facticity**

What is it that state-of-mind tells us about our death? We realize tha**t death is something that is not chosen by us, but is forced upon us**, or to put it in more existential terms, we are thrown into it. The thrownness of Dasein reveals itself in the awareness that we are going to die. The mood that reveals this to us is dread

**Fallenness**

Dasein tries to avoid the confrontation of the meaning of death. This does not mean that they-self pretends that death doesn't exist, nor that one tries to avoid situations that may bring about accidental death. Fallenness, of course, refers to the various ways by which they-self seeks to avoid a true understanding of what it means to die.

How the inauthentic self interprets death

The they-self interpret death in such a way as to convince us that death is not really ours by treating death always as an actuality and never as a possibility.

**If I treat death only as an actuality and never as a possibility, I can never consider my own death.** As long as I am conscious, actual death belongs to someone else. Only others have actually died.

**I cannot fear my own death.** (I must fear something actual. Hence when I fear death at all, **I fear someone else's death.**) This is why the inauthentic way to relate to death is to "fear" death. To dread, however, is to be uncannily aware of one's own possible dying. **The strategy of they-selves** in their effort to cover up an authentic understanding of death, **is to treat death as an event or object that can be feared. So I fear dying in a plane or by a snake but I dread the possibility of not-to-be.**

**What is inauthentic is not avoiding the actual experience of dying, but avoiding the full significance of our ability not-to-be.**

Our self-deceptions are not so crass and ineffectual as to try, for example, to convince us that there is no such thing as death. The they-self does not try to convince us of superhuman powers or immortality. It allows us to say: "Oh, yes, we will die someday." But it takes the stinging significance out of that awareness

Hence **the harshness of the inevitability of death is softened by the uncertainty of its when.** The everyday sentence **"I shall die someday" can be made authentic only when that last word is cruelly torn away to leave the stark: "I shall die!"**

To know that I am capable of not-being also reveals that I am capable of being. I am free to grasp fully that I am capable of being and not-being, or not to grasp it.

**The awareness of death points out one of the most persistent doctrines of Heidegger's philosophy: that possibility means more than merely a future actuality.**

How can possibility be meaningful outside of its becoming actual? The existential answer is freedom. By showing that death, as an existential awareness of possible not-being, is meaningful authentically only as a possibility, Heidegger has laid the foundation for treating freedom and authenticity as ontologically significant terms.

Reflection upon the possibility of not-being reveals the possibility of being in a way in which "possibility" is no longer seen merely as an abstract logical function of not-yet-actual, but is seen rather as an essential manner in which a human being exists; and that essential manner is given the name "freedom." **Heidegger's analysis of death, then, is not the basis for morbidity and despair; it is rather the source of freedom and authentic existence.**

#### Chapter VII – Authentic experience <a href="#_hlodvra2cbvc" id="_hlodvra2cbvc"></a>

Twofold characteristic of freedom: first, that it places a terrible burden on the free man, often forcing him to seek almost any means to avoid its full significance; and second, that it isolates the free man from the comfort and security of an ordered existence, by avoiding choices one becomes snared in inauthenticity

The source from which one can focus directly upon one's authentic self is, according to Heidegger, the voice of conscience. According to Heidegger, the great human existentials that expose authentic self-hood and the basis of freedom

To want to have a conscience is the basis for authenticity-this implies that to want not to have a conscience

is inauthentic. Hence one who seeks to live in such a way as to be without any possibility of ever being guilty-one who seeks to deny the very possibility of guilt-is one who is hiding behind the they-self and hence inauthentic.

**Guilt precedes morality**

Granted that there are such things as morals, and that there is such a thing as ethical understanding, what must be presupposed about the human consciousness in order that there be any inclination or desire to do what is right or to know what one ought to do in the first place? **Why did I ask myself what it was I ought to do unless there is already, in the very structure of my consciousness, a kind of persuasion that it indeed matters that I do what I ought to do?**

**Interpretation of conscience**

Dasein’s disclosure has been established as based on existentiality, state-of-mind, and fallenness; t**he disclosure of conscience for the most part follows this general pattern** but without fallness, since it can’t be a characteristic of the authentic self, which is replaced by “Discourse”.

**The essential character of conscience is that of calling**. **Unless we are quiet and listen to the call of conscience, we will never hear it.** The difference between calling and speaking is the fact that there must be an action to ‘call’ about.

**Unless it was genuinely possible for someone to be guilty, conscience would have no meaning** since conscience has been interpreted as a call from the self to the self, there must be a meaningful choice for Dasein, either to be or not to be the self. The latter possibility is grounded in Dasein's being the basis of a notness-guilt.

**Resoluteness**

**To be authentic means to be resolute**, to be free to choose one's own manner of existence, and so forth. The term focuses upon an individual's unique assertion of his own existence, freely grounded in responsibility and guilt.

**Authenticity never implies hermit-like loneliness or stoic detachment from world events**. It does suggest a clear awareness of the self as a self, and a realization that one alone is responsible for the way one exists, and it avoids the slavery of the they-self.

**The resolute man is guilty, he knows that he is guilty, and he wants to have a conscience.** In fact, it is in realizing the nature of his conscience and his guilt that he becomes resolute

#### Chapter VII – Time <a href="#_bpuq5ru65f4a" id="_bpuq5ru65f4a"></a>

The central issue of this chapter and indeed of the entire Being and Time is to show that, for a human being as Dasein, "to be" is always "to be temporal". **The ontological meaning of Being is time**

**62. Anticipatory Resoluteness**

If one examines the characteristics of authentic anticipation, even on the existentiell ievel, it becomes obvious that resoluteness is an essential ingredient of anticipation.

Resoluteness reveals to Dasein that it is guilty all the time, and hence already contained in the idea of resoluteness is the concept of "as long as it is" or "until it ends". **To be guilty means to be responsible and free for responsibility as long as one lives.** But "as long as one lives" implies awareness of death.

**63. Circularity of the being question**

The hermeneutic process is a circle in that it proceeds from a whole to a part, and then back to the whole, as in the case of language, words, and language again.

**The existential analytic is based upon the fact that, already and in advance, I have a vague understanding of what it means to be.** But if I already know what it means to be, then why analyze the ways of Being (the existentials) in order to discover what it means to be? The answer is because **my first understanding of what it means to be is not very profound, it is unthematic,** distorted, and, because of its lack of certainty and clarity, covered up (_untrue-letheia_)

Just as it is easy to miss the full beauty of the sonatas by merely hearing them and not listening to them, so too **is it a danger that the full meaning of existence can escape our grasp**. One must listen creatively to the sonatas of Beethoven, and this kind of listening does violence to a mere hearing of them in the background. **Likewise, the awareness of existence requires violence done to the everyday perspective of existence**. Unless violence were done to the circle of interpretation, there would indeed be a meaningless return to it. W**e exist. Furthermore, to some extent we understand our existence. This understanding, however, must be perfected, enriched, and thematized.** To give meaning to our existence, however, we do not need to go to any source other than our own existence (to a substance-God, for example, or a teleological humanism). This is the whole point of the "circle." The meaning of our existence lies within our existence, not outside of it. If this is true, then to find the meaning of existence one must analyze what one is.

**64. Care and selfhood**

What is the proper ontological characterization of the self? It must be analyzed in terms of Dasein's Being-in-the-world. **The self is not an isolated subject; it is not an entity within the world as other entities or substances.** Rather, **the self is an "I who cares"** The self is structured within the phenomenon of caring.

This means that **one does not proceed from the analysis of "I think"** which yields an isolated and independent subject, **but rather from "I care" which necessarily describes the self as already in the world.** What, then, is the self, the “I”? It is that which is exposed through authentic existence and is covered up in inauthentic existence. T**he self then becomes that quality which distinguishes the authentic from the inauthentic. It is that which is aware of what it means to be.** The self appears to be more of a condition or a characteristic of existence rather than a thing. For in inauthentic existence, we lose the self, cover it up.

**"Self," then, is not an entity. It is a characteristic of Being,**

Since we have already seen that Dasein's Being is care → What is the ontological meaning of care? The answer is: temporality.

**65. Temporality and care**

How is it possible for there to be anticipatory resoluteness? Because there is a future

When we ask for the ground or the possibility of Dasein's existence, we must formulate the inquiry in terms of anticipatory resoluteness. **Anticipatory resoluteness has been exposed as Being-toward one's possibilities.** But how is it possible to be "toward" anything at all? Only because there is a future. **The future is meaningful to one because one goes toward the**

**future. To have a future means to expect, to anticipate, to look forward to.** Hence the future is meaningful. If the future were merely a not-yet now, it could have no meaning for us at all.

The future is meaningful to me because it is one of the ways in which I exist. In fact, the future, as a way of existing, turns out to be the ultimate presupposition of authentic existence

**3 Ekstases of time (in order of significance)**

1. **Future**: By far **the most important** for Heidegger's analysis, bears the locus of existence given the the priority of possibility
2. **Past**: Is significant in a present sense, for example promises of yesterday are important today and it is almost impossible to understand what we are without conceiving of ourselves as having already been
3. **Present**: Heidegger's answer to the question of how the present is meaningful shifts the inquiry from seeing the present as that in which something occurs, to the actual carrying out of an action. Ontologically conceived, the present is making present. Thus it is the actual carrying out of an action that makes the present significant.

**Hence to conceive of time as a string or series of isolated moments or "nows" is completely foreign to one's existential experience**

**Simplified**

As a human being, I have a future. This means that the future is significant to me. It is because of my possibilities that the future is significant; in fact, ultimately, my ability to have possible ways of Being is what the future means.

On the other hand, I perform actions and find myself creating situations. In this way the present is significant to me. The present is not significant as a knife-edged instant, nor as an abstraction from the measure of change. What it means for me to be in the present is to perform actions and be in situations.

Finally, the basis from which the past is significant to me is my forgetting and remembering. Unless I existed in such a way that I was capable of this, the past would not be meaningful.

The three characteristics of authentic existence (of care) are grounded, then, in the three ekstases of time

1. it is **ahead of itself in terms of its awareness of possibilities** → **Future** → **Understanding**
2. it is **already in the world** → **Past** → **State-of-mind**
3. it is **alongside the entities it discovers** → **Present** → **Fallenness**

**Time is necessary**

To conceive of time, then, as either subjective or objective is to overlook the essentially existential character of how to view time. Time and temporality are not objective, in the sense that they can be conceptualized as independent entities, or that they have significance independent of human existence; nor are they subjective in the sense that they are the pure forms of intuition or the mere faculty by which change is measured. Time and temporality are insofar as a human being is; but this is not to suggest a subjectivism, because it has nothing to do with the problem of knowledge or the subject of any other kind of activity. Temporality is exposed as the necessary ontological condition for the ways in which we exist.

Speaking somewhat loosely, one might say that authentic understanding (anticipation) lies in Dasein going toward the future, whereas inauthentic understanding (waiting) lies in the future coming toward Dasein.

**State-of-mind as temporal**

It would be a herculean task of thankless detail to examine all possible moods to show their respective temporal bases. Such a task would not only be all but impossible, it would also be unnecessary. Instead Heidegger chooses those two forms of state-of-mind that have been analyzed in the existential analytic: the inauthentic mood of fear; and that essential characteristic of authentic existence, dread.

**When one is afraid it is the future that one retreats from**. Fear holds back, is a kind of "forgetting of one-self”. Forgetting, as we have seen, is that characteristic of the past which is inauthentic. In fact, the reason why **fear is seen as a mode of inauthentic existence** is precisely that fear, **through a forgetting of one's Being, directs one's attention away from the question of Being.**

Meanwhile **repetition**, the authentic mode of having-been, **is the ontological ground of dread**

**Dread**, which is the authentic mode, **must be seen in terms of the authentic ekstases: repetition, moment-of-vision, and anticipation.**

**Fear**, the inauthentic mode, **must be seen in terms of** the inauthentic ekstases: **forgetting, making-present, and waiting.**

**Temporality of falling**

The everyday view of time is usually that in which the present is seen as the locus of significance and reality. Such a view of the present makes the happening and occurrence of events a series of actual facts which can be indifferently observed. It is the view of time presupposed by substance metaphysicians and scientists. Unfortunately, from the ontological viewpoint it is inauthentic.

**Temporality of Discourse**

The tenses of grammar in most modern sophisticated languages make it impossible to speak a meaningful sentence unless that sentence is formulated in some form of temporal significance. If language itself is structured on "tenses" like past, present, future, past perfect, present perfect, etc., then the very structure of language reveals the ultimate temporal nature of our consciousness and the manner in which we are aware of ourselves and the world.

Dasein's temporal characteristics are what make possible the modes of existence that we know as existentials.

**69. Temporality of concern**

The key to seeing Heidegger's argument lies in his use of the two terms "awaiting" and "retaining." It is easy enough to see how, in the busy involvement of working with equipment, one responds to the learned expectation of certain occurrences. A skilled driver, by retaining from his experience, knows how his automobile will respond to certain throttle manipulation; he awaits or expects the same kind of response as he now manipulates the throttle.

We are speaking of a general way in which one relates to the world. It is not only complex machinery, but doorknobs, forest paths, knives and forks, et al. to which we relate in this most primordial of ways of Being-in-the-world. Even as innocent an act as wrenching a doorknob consists of awaiting and retaining, and it is made meaningful by the temporal ekstasis of inauthentic present-making-present.

**Temporality of transcendence**

**Transcendence refers to that state by which or from which one can reflect upon the totality of human experience.** Kant refers to his kind of philosophizing as "transcendental," and by that he meant that his philosophy takes its point of departure from asking how such-and-such a thing (experience, for example) is possible. The problem of transcendence is indigenous to philosophizing itself: one can always ask how an account of any human activity is itself possible.

Consider an empiricist, who might want to say that only sense experience can reveal true judgments. Is the sentence " All true judgments are based on experience" itself based on experience? If it is not based on experience (which surely seems to be the case), then the very meaning of the sentence refutes itself.

**For Heidegger some form of "transcendence" is necessary if philosophy is to be possible at all. His claim is that it is only because we are finite that we are capable of transcending the entities of the world and our use of them**. Our finitude provides us with transcendence. The way in which I exist is such that I have temporal ekstases. These ekstases are so structured that it is possible, in each of them, to do a kind of stepping-out, by which I am capable of reflecting upon my existence-structure.

Heidegger goes further than Nietzsche by arguing that the very ontological ground of transcendence is man's finitude. T**he argument is simple: There can be no transcendence without temporal ekstases with horizons.**

#### Chapter IX – History <a href="#_ad5iof9b50h6" id="_ad5iof9b50h6"></a>

It is necessary to point out that the German term for "history" (Geschichte) is also the term for "story". To understand the ontological meaning of Dasein is to understand that the telling of a story is the fundamental way in which the meaning of existence is illuminated

Unless we were able to tell stories, whether fact or fiction, the meaning of our existence would not be available to us.

Someone’s story does not really begin with his birth. For one is born into a culture and a

tradition a heritage-that preceded they and yet was surely as much a part of him as his own limbs. Our story and heritage and our destiny (what outlives us) is what makes existence meaningful This too must be emphasized: it is not the events that make a story; it is a story that makes the events possible and meaningful. The very structure of a story, which is a priori, is used constantly to illuminate how we exist in the world.

Heidegger argues that fate, heritage, and destiny are what make historicality possible. "Historicality" means, to Heidegger, that existential awareness through which one understands Being in history, and as such it is the ultimate ground and cause of historical awareness and

historical research.

**72. Existential exposition of history**

How does one account for the unification of that which "has" the diverse experiences of life?

If we grant that life provides us with a great variety of experiences and events, and we wish nonetheless to

maintain a unity of the self that has these experiences, some explanation must be given.

It is only because a human being can exist in such a way as to stretch along between birth and death that he is capable of having an historical sense by which the "facts" of history are made relevant and significant.



**73. Dasein Historizacing**

If we consider a certain item of equipment that was used in the past but exists in the present merely as an item of historical significance, there is a problem. Let us take as an example Lincoln's pipe.

**What is historical is not the simple presence-at-hand existence but the existential involvement with the world** (world = user-instrument).

Hence it is the use of the tools of the world's equipment that describes a world that is historically significant. It is Lincoln's Being-in-the-world in terms of his usage of the pipe as an instrument of relaxation that is no more-that "world" no longer exists. The pipe itself, though, still exists. Hence **it is not entities as such that are "historical," but the "worlds'' to which these entities are existentially related.** "Worlds," in this sense, however, are existentials of Dasein, and hence only Dasein is historical. It is Dasein's Being-in-the-world that is historical.

What is history about? **It is about the worlds of those Daseins whose stretching-along between their respective births and deaths constitute a significance of the past**. In short, it is the historicality of the various. Daseins in terms of their Being-in-the-world that is not only what history is about, but also what constitutes the ground of history

The three terms that Heidegger uses to ground historicality are heritage, fate and destiny

**Heritage**

Seems to be that existential awareness of one's tradition as significantly determining. One's heritage seems to **consist in one's understanding of the various stories and interpretations of past events that directly affect one's comprehension of oneself**, it is the bold acceptance of both the guilt and the honor that go with

that history. Dasein is resolute in that it does not merely know the history of one's tradition and family, but indeed freely commits itself to the full significance of the values

**Fate**

Fate is used by Heidegger in the sense of **one's awareness of one's finitude**. Of the three characteristics of Dasein's historicality, fate seems to be **the most important, since it is fate that is exposed as being temporal**. Fate is awareness of one's limited possibilities and the ensuing significance of one's choices and decisions made in the flux of these possibilities. **An irresolute man (an inauthentic man) can have no fate and hence no historicality.**

**Destiny**

Is applied only to peoples or to nations. **It is a kind of fate on the level of a whole people**, as one might speak of the "fate of a nation." One must be aware of the destiny that one's group, nation, people, or religion can manifest in the course of history.

**75. Historicality and world history**

History is not about facts, no matter how they are bound together in any kind of sequence, but rather it is about "worlds" in which resolute Daseins are

As we have seen, a subject-object relationship presupposes a world in which the subject and the object take reference to one another. There is no such thing as an isolated and denuded subject, just as there is no such thing as a plain, bare "fact." **Both the "knowing subject" and the "fact" that is known occur in a world of already existing significance. Hence what is historical in the primordial sense is neither the subject nor the object, but that background of significance which makes the subject-object relationship possible.** This "background" is called the "world." What history historicizes about is Being-in-the-world.

**It is due to my fallenness and my inauthenticity that I look upon history as made up of facts**. It is the chief characteristic of the "they" to avoid and overlook possibilities, and search out only the safety of the facts. The inauthentic view of history sees history as a series of no-longer "facts," cannot in principle be significant. **To be sure, facts can be learned**. Indeed, facts about a no-longer past can be analyzed scientifically. **But that is not history, for history must be significant.**

History is grounded in one's fate and destiny, therefore it must constantly be reinterpreted; not only because of each generation, but indeed each individual adds his own unique perspective to the understanding of his fate and his people's destiny, and hence the historical perspective must be changed to fit that aspect of human existence which asserts itself as most important in a particular era or group, or even in a single great man.

**Historicity**

Is prior to any world history. For Heidegger _“Dasein is its past”_ but we exist as beings that have a past. We are constantly oriented towards the future but we are bringing the past along with us. Historicity is this shared past.

**78-83. Temporality and Time**

"Time" refers to the world, or to objects within the world, or even to the relationship between subject-knower and object-known. "Temporality," on the other hand, refers to Dasein's existence. Dasein, as temporal, "creates" time or "sees" time. **Time,** then**, is grounded in temporality, and not the other way around.**

Heidegger tries to answer Is "time," as distinct from temporality, subjective or objective? What, in short, is the nature and structure of time? What is the relationship between existential temporality and that which we call "time" but which we don't seem to know very much about?

**As an existential mode of Being-in-the-world we make use of the quipmental structure of the world in 3 terms:**

* **Awaiting** gives us a perspective which is represented by the simple temporal term "then."
* **Retaining** gives us a perspective represented by the simple temporal phrase "on that former occasion" or even "ago" (I retain my awareness of something I tasted three days ago)
* **Acting** gives us a perspective which is represented by the temporal term "now." (I am aware of what I am doing in an action now-at-this-moment).

Hence, we can discover the primordial time references: **then, ago and now,** this structure is called datability. Thus, Dasein does not get its nows, thens, and agos from some external source, but from its own structure of existence**. Dasein's temporality is the basis for time. It is only because I can await, retain, and act that I have understanding of now, then, and ago.**

**80. Within Time-Time as the Object of Concern**

**Public time is that measured and counted time which is available for every man**. Daytime and nighttime are not first and foremost foundations for a simple time structure. Rather, they are the chief characteristics for being-able-to-work and not-being-able-to-work. Sunrise, then, in a primitive kind of understanding, means: "Now I can go to work-now I can see." On the other hand, sunset means: "Now I can no longer work or see. It is time to rest”

**The existential meaning of public time**

Five o'clock means getting off work; eight o'clock means meeting one's girlfriend at the corner; etc. Why is it the case that the shadow's falling on a certain measured line has significance? Time is not that shadow, nor that line, nor even the combination of the two. The shadow on the line represents a kind of activity that occurs whenever that shadow falls on that line. (When it falls on XII, it's time to eat.)

**Public time belongs in the world**

**Public time, then, is neither subjective nor objective**. It is not subjective, because it is not a characteristic of the subject**, but rather a mode or way in which the subject is in the world.** It is not objective, because it is not the characteristic of that which is known, since it comes before knowing (in this sense, Kant is right). On the other hand, it cannot come before subjectivity or objectivity, since "to be before'' presupposes time. P**ublic time can be properly explained only as an existential characteristic of Being-in-the-world, which itself is the background for any subject-object distinction.**

The task for Heidegger in this section was to show that time was temporal. Strange as the task may seem, it has amounted to an interpretation of time that saves it from the ridiculousness of objective metaphysical reality, and the meaninglessness of a simple a priori epistemological form of intuition. The basis for time is Dasein's temporality.

**81. Ordinary Time**

Ordinary time == the time "by the clock"

**3 things that make the "ordinary" view of time inauthentic:**

* **Lacks datability**

To conceive of time as clock time is to make “agos, thens, and nows” modes of Being-in-the-world without any real justification, since the moments of ordinary time are not existential

* **Lacks significance**

Ordinary time is not significant, since significance is to participate in the as-structure, which a mere counted moment cannot do. Significance must, in the case of ordinary time, always be added on to an event that occurs in time.

* **Seen as infinite** (an endless series of now-points)

If time is seen as pinpoint nows, t**here is no reason for the mind not to conceive of there being an endless series or chain of nows**. But if time is infinite, then the understanding of the world is such that the world is also seen as infinite. The voice of the "they" is infinite- as long as there is time. But **time is infinite, so the "they" does not die. I, however, as that entity which has significance, can die. And hence an infinite time is not at all applicable to me.**

To be sure, inauthentic existence does not make any overt claims to being infinite; as such, it would be exposed as false. Rather, it conceives of time in such a way that time has no meaning, and hence no end. A time without end does not relate to Dasein as a significant concept. **As long as ordinary time is treated as if it were infinite, Dasein is forever kept from fully realizing its finitude, and hence its own self as able-not-to-be.**

Heidegger's interpretation of ordinary time, then, comes back to support the doctrines exhibited in the very first sections of the existential analytic. Consistently with the entire argument, the whole view of authentic and inauthentic existence comes down to a proper or improper understanding of time. **A misunderstanding of the finitude of time characterizes inauthenticity. What is authentic must be finite.** **Authentic existence means to be aware of the possibility of not-being, to be aware of one's finitude. **_**To be is to be in time**._
