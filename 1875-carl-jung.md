# 1875 Carl Jung

### Carl Jung <a href="#_apcr9y2jtjh0" id="_apcr9y2jtjh0"></a>

### Bio <a href="#_uckct6e5xem2" id="_uckct6e5xem2"></a>

(1875 – 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. Jung's work was influential in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. He came to the attention of Sigmund Freud, the two men conducted a lengthy correspondence and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.

Freud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his "new science" of psychoanalysis. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to follow his older colleague's doctrine, and a schism became inevitable. This resulted in the establishment of Jung's analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis.

Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development.

Jung was also an artist, craftsman and builder as well as a prolific writer.

### The Unconscious <a href="#_v89duc2bsdhw" id="_v89duc2bsdhw"></a>

For Jung **Doctors urgently need psychological knowledge since nervous disorders as hysteria are of animic origin** and therefore require animic treatments

_**“The doctor must also be a psychologist, that is, a connoisseur of the human soul”**_

#### Trauma theory <a href="#_qgniu7u4f1f4" id="_qgniu7u4f1f4"></a>

Psychology begins with a case by Breuer (1880) with Ana, a patient with systemic aphasia and partial paralysis but without brain injuries

Breuer helps her through "talking cure" by remembering the fact that he put Ana in that state and releasing her from her neurosis

_“Hence the so-called trauma theory, according to which the hysterical symptom comes from an injured state of mind (traumas) **whose impression is unconsciously preserved for years.”**_

It depends on the person how the same trauma affects them, so we can say people have a **disposition for certain traumas.**

Besides trauma theory Jung says that also love can be a catalyist for inconsicous conflict , hetells the story of a loving triangle where one woman ends with the husbund of her friend althoguh she consciously didnt want that, in this scenario there was no trauma but rather an erotic conflict. The power of love is not trivial.

#### Chapter II - Sexual theory <a href="#_2qcuvxy660ko" id="_2qcuvxy660ko"></a>

_“In neurosis there are two tendencies, which are in strict mutual opposition and of which one is unconscious._

_The neurotic is just a special case of the cultured man who disagrees with himself.”_

There are 2 techniques to understand the unconscious facts:

1. **Hipnosis**: This was the first method but is not longer used
2. **Associative method:** Who for example using dreams tries to understand the conflict, for Jung (and Freud) dreams were a source of secrets and related to the most important things in a patient's life.

According to Freud the origin of the conflict is related to sexuality, he believed that repressed sexual desires that clash with our moral sexuality is the root of the conflict.

**On sexuality and morality**

_“We must not forget, in fact, that morality did not come down from Sinai in the form of tables of law to impose itself on the people, but rather it is a function of the human soul; a function as old as humanity itself. Morality is not imposed from outside, but each one carries it within himself a priori; not the law, but the moral being”_

_“Today's sexual morality is formless and barbaric, because it only looks at sexuality and not at people and their behavior. Sexuality is not the devil, a devil that in marriage appears in a tolerable and admitted way but outside of marriage appears as absolute evil. Sexuality is capable of a higher value if we relate it to the moral development of the individual”_

**Chapter III**

There is another point of view, proposed by Adler which views not sexual conflict as the driving force but as Nietzsche would say, a will of power. The conflict occurs when we encounter something we can’t control

#### Chapter IV <a href="#_5fpolbnazpxu" id="_5fpolbnazpxu"></a>

**Adler sets the focus of the conflict in the subject** while **Freud** considers his patients in perpetual dependence on **objects**

**Adler → Subject Freud → Object**

_“ **In Adler's opinion there is an extraordinary accentuation of the subject**_

_Adler finds that a subject who feels inferior and of less value "tries to secure" an illusory superiority through "arrangements" directed against parents, teachers, authorities …”_



**Extrovert vs Introvert**

Jung proposes to solve the conflict between the theories of Freud and Adler that there are 2 different types of person: **introverts and extroverts** (Like Nietzsche's Apollo and Dionysus**)**

He also believes that both of these are reductive and destructive.

_“The sexual theory is situated in the point of view of the object and the theory of power is situated in the position of the subject; because **the extravert always accentuates the object and its relationship with it**, while **the introvert accentuates the subject, detaching himself from the object”**_

For Jung, **each person has an available energy,** he gives the example of a man who retired to start enjoying himself but instead that depresses him because he has nowhere to channel that energy, to which he ends up absolutely depressed (nowadays antidepressants would solve that redirection of "energy")

Jung proposes that “Nominalism vs Realism”, **“Idealism vs Empiricism”**, "Spiritualism vs Materialism” vs a**re actually caused by the Introvert vs Extrovert personalities.** The introvert is always meditating or thinking before acting while the extrovert maintains a positive relation with things (materialist). **They are both symbiotic personalities**

**In reality each person has a bit of each type of personality, and the conflict is internal**

It can even happen that in a relationship each one changes its type under a given circumstance and this will actually cause conflict

Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite **different from the modern** idea for Jung introversion and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: **introverts interpret the world subjectively, whereas extraverts interpret the world objectively**

#### Chapter V - Individual and collective unconscious <a href="#_bqkc47ueoknp" id="_bqkc47ueoknp"></a>

_“In each individual, part of the personal reminiscences there are the great "primordial" images. The fact of this inheritance explains the incredible phenomenon that certain legends are repeated throughout the earth in identical ways._

For Jung there are 2 layers of the unconscious:

* **Personal** or subconscious: _Contains lost memories, repressed painful representations (deliberately forgotten), subliminal perceptions (still unconscious) and thoughts that are not mature enough._
* **Collective** or absolute: _the contents of the latter can be found in all heads. The primordial images are the oldest, most general and deepest thoughts of humanity”_

Jung seems more metaphysical than psychologist

_The collective unconscious extends to the pre-infantile period, that is, to the remains of ancestral life. While the memorative images of the personal unconscious are in a way swollen because they have been lived, the memorable traces of the collective unconscious are flaccid, because they are forms that have not been individually lived. When the regression of psychical energy reaches the traces and sentiments of ancestral life, then the mythological images awaken; we discover an inner spiritual world, of which we suspected nothing before and have stark contrast to our usual conceptions._

For Jung we must look for a path that opens the communication between conscious reality and the unconscious

**Archetypes**

**Are defined as universal, archaic symbols and images that derive from the collective unconscious**. They are the psychic counterpart of instinct. It is described as **a kind of innate nonspecific knowledge, derived from the sum total of human history**, which prefigures and directs conscious behavior.

**Examples are the mother, the child, the trickster, and the flood among others.**

Archetypes, according to Jung, seek actualization within the context of an individual's environment, for example, the mother archetype is actualized in the mind of the child by the evoking of innate anticipations of the maternal archetype when the child is in the proximity of a maternal figure who corresponds closely enough to its archetypal template.

They are similar to Plato’s Ideas

In this book Jung shows that even the idea of “conservation of energy” is an archetype, as seen in the bush on fire Moses encountered, the eternal fire of Heraclitus to the founder of thermodynamics Robert Mayer who according to Jung figured it out thanks to intuition

**The origin of archetypes**

An archetype is a kind of predisposition to always reproduce similar mystical representations. The archetypes are the traces, often repeated, of the subjective reactions generated by physical events, such as the sunrise → the myth of the solar hero

To Jung as we participate in the collective unconscious, we live in a world of magic, demons and ogres. Since these are the things that have been set into us from a previous era.

In earlier times these thoughts were not separated from the individual conscience, since these beings were not a psychological entity but rather existed as real entities.

_“**Until the enlightenment era it was not understood that the gods do not really exis**t, but are only projections. With this they were eliminated. **But the corresponding psychological function was in no way eliminated**, rather it passed into the unconscious_. “

**Before, men relieved their libido in the worship of the gods, today it is repressed** and the lack of an outlet for that energy results in mass killings as in the French Revolution. This is similar to Nietzsche's idea of ressentiment.

**On God and the irrational**

_**“The concept of God is an absolutely necessary psychological function** of an irrational nature that **has nothing to do with the question of the existence of God.**_

_“I consider it more advisable to consciously recognize the idea of God, because otherwise we turn into God anything else, usually something insufficient and foolish.”_

Meaning that if we don't worship a god in the heavens we may worship one on earth like Science, Men or a totalitarian ruler

_“Men must not be identified with reason since men are not simply and can never be just rational. The irrational must not and should not be removed. **Gods can not and should not die”**_

**On adulthood**

_“But **it is a great mistake to suppose that the meaning of life is exhausted in the phase of sexual and expansive youth**. That a woman for example is exhausted, with menopause**. The autumn of human life is as rich in meaning as spring,** although its meaning and purpose are completely different. Man has a double purpose: the first is the natural end, generation of offspring and their care**. Once this end has been fulfilled, the other phase begins: that of cultural end”**_

When we don’t understand this difference we suffer because we have different expectations of what life should be and therefore conflict/neurosis appears

_“This is especially noticeable in mothers, who put the only meaning of their lives in their children and believe they fall into a bottomless void when they have to abandon them. It is not surprising, therefore, that many serious neuroses appear at the beginning of the autumn of life. **It's a kind of second puberty**”_

**Enantiodromia**

It’s the emergence of the **unconscious opposite in the course of time.** This characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs **when an extreme, one-sided tendency dominates conscious life**; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up which eventually breaks through the conscious control.

Similar to the principle of equilibrium in the natural world, in that any extreme is opposed by the system in order to restore balance. Similar to the yin-yang.

**One can only avoid enantiodromia if it’s able to get rid of the unconscious**, not by repressing it (or it will come back from behind) but **by facing it as something truly different from the self**

#### Chapter VI - Synthetic method <a href="#_rbchl6s8csnu" id="_rbchl6s8csnu"></a>

There are 2 types of interpretations of dreams:

* **Analytical**: It analyzes the dream by dividing it in parts in order to understand background, _“decomposes the content of the dream into complexes of reminiscences that refer to real conditions”_
* **Synthetic/Constructive**: It helps us understand the dream in its relationship with the archetypes. _“It detaches from real occasions the complexes of recollections, situated in the background and presents them as trends. It achieves that the collective mythological or psychological contents get detached from the objects of consciousness and are consolidated as psychological realities outside the individual psyche_”

#### Chapter VIII <a href="#_h4ju9aihg2w" id="_h4ju9aihg2w"></a>

_“Neurosis is the sign that in the unconscious there is a deposit full of energy, a kind of charge that can explode, although the cause is not known.”_

Jung acknowledges that a **sickness of the soul can affect the body and vice versa**, **dreams are tools that let us know preemptively that we are getting ill**

**Last words**

_**“A psychology that satisfies only the understanding can never be a practical psychology**, since the whole of **the soul cannot be apprehended by the understanding alone.** Whether we like it or not, **the total vision of the universe besieges us, because the soul asks for an expression that encompasses its total set. “**_
