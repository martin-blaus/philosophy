### Bio <a href="#_ng3ddt2z0894" id="_ng3ddt2z0894"></a>

(1892 - 1940) was a German Jewish philosopher. Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to aesthetic theory, literary criticism, and historical materialism. He was associated with the Frankfurt School.

In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin committed suicide on the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape from the invading Wehrmacht. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.

### The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction <a href="#_16uzsuxpsbxi" id="_16uzsuxpsbxi"></a>

Benjamin's thesis is that Art is coming to resemble economic production, albeit at a delayed pace is that mechanical reproduction devalues the aura (uniqueness) of art, it loses its artistic authenticity, its cultural authority; and it brings forth a new aestheticization of politics for the production of art.

#### Mechanical reproduction <a href="#_x1ve85u0mb25" id="_x1ve85u0mb25"></a>

Benjamins describes historically how the mechanical reproduction of art evolved, **from manual reproduction to mass production,** beginning with reproducing art manually in Greece, to engraving and lithography in the middle ages and finally reaching photography and film (new technologies can follow the same analysis as the latter, or even more pronounced).

Mechanical reproduction not only changed how art was developed but **changed the very definition of what art is.** Reproduction makes art lose its authenticity, its uniqueness. It can be anywhere, can be copied and distributed and this rise is completely related with mass movements, mass production and consumption.

#### Aura <a href="#_lzmj5y18vcfm" id="_lzmj5y18vcfm"></a>

To understand what aura is, Benjamin compares it to the aura of natural phenomena.

_“**We define the aura of the latter as the unique phenomenon of a distance, however close it may be.** If, while resting on a summer afternoon, **you follow with your eyes a mountain range** on the horizon or a branch which casts its shadow over you, **you experience the aura of those mountains,** of that branch.”_

Is an effect of a work of art being uniquely present in time and space. The aura of a painting is this feeling it **inspires similar to watching a sunset** or the moon. The art object **“gains” more aura the more “distant” it is from you**, how a painting in a museum can’t be approached, the monalisa vs a photo of the monalisa.

So with **modern reproduction the Aura of the work of art withers.**

_“**The aura decays because masses desire to bring things “closer”,** every day the urge grows stronger to get hold of an object at very close range by way of its likeness, its reproduction”._ Masses create reproducible realities and hence destroy art’s uniqueness

_“**The technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition“**_

Benjamin is not saying that the Aura is good or bad, rather it’s different. For example before art was not accessible to most people but it did had a greater effect on us.

The reproduction now goes to the beholder, reactivating the object reproduced. We don't have to go to Paris to see the Eiffel Tower or Monalisa.. “_The simultaneous contemplation of paintings by a large public is an early symptom of the crisis of painting not related with photography but in an independent manner by the appeal of art works to the masses._”

The loss of aura seems to have both positive and negative effects for Benjamin. The aura of art is fundamentally connected to tradition while reproduced art is completely detached from it. So in the modern age, **art is ‘liberated’ from its dependence on ritual.** As a result, both the autonomy of art but also the connection with tradition is lost, so **art can be experienced in a new way.** In the way a movie can be recreated like the Justice Leagues or memes bringing new meaning to old paintings.

**The uniqueness of a work of art**

The aura of art arises from its place in tradition, as an object of rituals.

_“The uniqueness **is inseparable from its being embedded in the fabric of tradition**“_

The status of Venus had a different traditional context with Greeks, as an object of veneration, than with christian monks, as an idol. But they were both confronted with its uniqueness, that is, its aura.

_“Originally the contextual integration of art in tradition found its expression in the cult. We know that **the earliest artworks originated in the service of a ritual** – first the magical, then the religious kind. It is significant that **the existence of the work of art with reference to its aura is never entirely separated from its ritual function**. In other words, the unique value of the “authentic” work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value.”_

With the advent of photography and the simultaneous rise of socialism, art sensed that a crisis was approaching and “_it **reacted with the doctrine of l‟art pour l‟art,** that is, with a theology of art. This gave rise to what might be called **a negative theology in the form of the idea of “pure” art, which not only denied any social function of art but also any categorizing by subject matter.“**_

**‘Art for its sake’** basically says art does not need to justify itself, **it is a kind of religious faith.**

**The value of art was either in its misticy or in the object itself,** so still centered around tradition and rituals (be it secular or religious)

_“This ritualistic basis, however remote, is still recognizable as secularized ritual even in the most profane forms of the cult of beauty”,_ for example the secular cult of beauty in the Renaissance.

**The more art becomes designed for reproducibility** the less dependent it becomes of rituals and more in politics, and **its ideal becomes to be consumed by the masses.**

Art has moved from cult value (religious) → Exhibition value (a museum) → mechanical reproduction (A photography of a painting)

In these steps art has lost its aura but became more democratized.

_“For the first time in world history, **mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual”**_

**Giving up eternity**

Cinema contrary to older forms of art is not a done and finished thing, once the filming is finished there’s still editing and post-production, movies are not finished once, but multiple times. Nowadays it's common to have the director’s or the extended cut even.

_“Cinema is, thus, the work of art with the greatest ability to be improved and this capacity is connected with **its radical renunciation to pursue an eternal value”**_

The reaction to mass media is uncritical

_**“Mechanical reproduction of art changes the reaction of the masses toward art.** The **reactionary attitude toward a Picasso** painting changes **into the progressive reaction toward a Chaplin** movie._

_The greater the decrease in the social significance of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and enjoyment by the public. **The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the truly new is criticized with aversion**. With regard to the screen, the critical and the receptive attitudes of the public coincide”_

In the cinema **the reactions of the individual are predetermined by the mass** audience that is watching the film

#### Films <a href="#_l0dxgvlwl483" id="_l0dxgvlwl483"></a>

_**“Their most powerful agent**_ \[of mechanical reproduction] _**is the film**. Its social significance, particularly in its most positive form, is inconceivable without its destructive, cathartic aspect, that is, the liquidation of the traditional value of the cultural heritage.“_

The prevalence of film creates a culture of minor experts ready to judge art rather than lose themselves in participatory ritual.

_**“Masses seek distraction whereas art demands concentration from the spectator.** Reception in a state of **distraction**, which is increasing noticeably in all fields of art and is symptomatic of profound changes in apperception, **finds in the film its true means of exercise**. The film with its shock effect meets this mode of reception halfway. **The film makes the cult value recede into the background** not only by putting the public in the position of the critic, but also by the fact that at **the movies** this position r**equires no attention.** The public **is an examiner, but an absent-minded one”**_

For Benjamin, it is precisely the habit-formation potential in film’s barrage of images that leave no room for contemplation, the shock effect, which allows a distracted audience somehow critical, and therefore, **potent for mass mobilization.** For example progressive propaganda, but this revolutionary potential is just that, a potential.

Benjamin believes that the people can use the reproducibility of art in their favor, now anyone can be an author and have the potential to be viewed by the masses. The capitalist media, such as the film industry, seek to prevent such claims.

**”**_In Western Europe the capitalistic exploitation of the film denies consideration to modern man‟s legitimate claim to being reproduced.”_ **So the people must take hold of it**

**The actor**

_“The actor‟s performance is presented by means of a camera; he lacks the opportunity of the stage actor to adjust to the audience during his performance. This permits the audience to take the position of a critic, without experiencing any personal contact with the actor. **The audience‟s identification with the actor is really an identification with the camera.** Consequently the audience takes the position of the camera; **its approach is that of testing**. **This is not the approach to which cult values may be exposed.”**_

The aura of art is replaced by the commercial product that is the movie star

_“The film responds to the shriveling of the aura with **an artificial build-up of the “personality”** outside the studio. T**he cult of the movie star, fostered by the money of the film industry, preserves not the unique aura of the person but the “spell of the personality,”** the phony spell of a commodity.”_

**Aestheticization of politics**

**Fascism tends towards an aestheticization of politics**, in the sense of a spectacle in which it **allows the masses to express themselves without seeing their rights recognized,** and without affecting the relations of ownership which the proletarian masses aim to eliminate.

By mythologizing fascist regimes by mass media, the Fuhrer, the Bourgeois remain in place. Using art for domination they give the people a means to channel their rage against the system, without doing anything about it. The aestheticization of politics makes people feel great (i.e. Nazi propaganda, which was filmed with great angles and shots,made Germans proud of their country)

_**“All efforts to render political aesthetics culminate in one thing: war.** War and war only can set a goal for mass movements on the largest scale while respecting the traditional property system”_

_“Mankind, which in Homer‟s time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian gods, now is one for itself. **Its self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order.**“_

In a dialectic analysis Benjamin concludes that **we need to reverse the aestheticization of politics by politicizing** **the sensible.** _“Communism responds by politicizing art”,_ art is ultimately subordinate to political life

**By politicizing art Benjamin means to remove tradition from art** and of conventional, operational use, and recombine art in new ways. Reconstruct it as something to be used, recomposed, combined rhizomatically, as a montage.

But **the revolutionary power of art is truncated** if the audience absorbs the work of art, but can't **free itself from the mythologies** and alienated subjectivity of art.
