(1895 - 1973) was a German philosopher and sociologist who was famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the Frankfurt School of social research.

Horkheimer addressed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of mass culture using the philosophy of history as a framework which was the foundation of critical theory.

### Eclipse of Reason <a href="#_oiosxm4cxun" id="_oiosxm4cxun"></a>

After WWII the democratic world should’ve had the potential to become a utopia, it had just defeated the greatest evil, but instead hope for mankind is further away than ever before.

_“Even as technical knowledge expands the horizon of man's thought and activity, his autonomy as an individual, his ability to resist the growing apparatus of mass manipulation, his power of imagination, his independent judgment appear to be reduced. **Advance in technical facilities for enlightenment is accompanied by a process of dehumanization**”_

In this era of change it's up to us to decide the future of humanity (in hindsight we probably failed)

_“Whether this situation is a necessary phase in the general ascent of society or it will lead to a re-emergence of the neo-barbarism recently defeated on the battlefields, depends at least in part on our ability to interpret accurately the profound changes now taking place in the public mind and in human nature”_

The role of this book and of philosophy is not to tell us how to act, but to empower us to think critically

_“**Philosophy must not be turned into propaganda,** even for the best possible purpose. The world has more than enough propaganda... **Philosophy is not interested in issuing commands”**_

#### Subjective vs Objective Reason <a href="#_uzrfpffm327q" id="_uzrfpffm327q"></a>

There are 2 types of reason:

* **Objective**: Similar to Kant or Plato’s idea of reason, Ends > Means. It looks to answer questions like “What is a good life?”
* **Subjective/Instrumental**: Its interest lies in means, not ends, it does not care about the why? only focuses on the preservation of the self and of the community, it looks to answer questions like “if I want X, what actions must I take?”

Horkheimer's thesis is that **objective reason has increasingly become more** and more **subjectivized** (formalized) which means that _“thinking cannot be of any help in determining the desirability of any goal in itself”_ and _“**all our ultimate decisions depend upon factors other than reason”**_

**This by no means began with the Enlightenment**, **but rather with the first “mastery of nature”**, the first use of technology in a Heideggerian sense (domination of nature for human purposes).

#### Instrumental reason <a href="#_xsvnu0vnx863" id="_xsvnu0vnx863"></a>

_**“Having given up autonomy**, **reason has become an instrument**. Reason has become completely harnessed to the social process. Its operational value**, its role in the domination of men and nature, has been made the sole criterion”**_

Subjectivity is so oriented toward self-preservation that **the drive toward self-preservation is the only end left.** When reason is subjectivized **it becomes a mere tool for subjective gain**, to exploit Nature and humans alike.

_“What are **the consequences of the formalization of reason**? Justice, equality, happiness, tolerance, **all have lost their intellectual roots...** there is no rational agency authorized to appraise and link them to an objective reality”_

**Why do we need to access an objective world?**

**Without objective reason** there are no actual good things, so **reason can justify even nazism or slavery.** For example using “darwinian pseudoscience” to justify atrocities.

_“According to the philosophy of the average modern intellectual, **there is only one authority**, namely, **science**, conceived as the classification of facts and the calculation of probabilities._

To say that _“**justice** and freedom are **better in themselves** than injustice and oppression **is scientifically unverifiable and useless**. It has come to sound **as meaningless** in itself as would the statement that red is more beautiful than blue, or that **an egg is better than milk”**_

“_This **dehumanization of thinking affects the very foundations of our civilization”.** _ Without the metaphysical ideals of humanism, of freedom and liberty our current society has no solid foundations. Our values and tastes are just based on historical events rather than pragmatic reasons from enlightened individuals.

For example “_**The statement that dictatorship is bad is rationally valid only for those who are not its beneficiaries**… It may be just as meaningless to call one particular way of living, one religion, one philosophy better or higher or truer than another**. Since ends are no longer determined in the light of reason**, it is also impossible to say that one economic or political system, no matter how cruel and despotic, **is less reasonable than another.**”_

#### Against positivism <a href="#_lt7org360rhc" id="_lt7org360rhc"></a>

_“The so-called **practical world has no place for truth**, and therefore splits it to conform it to its own image: **the physical sciences are endowed with so-called objectivity, but emptied of human content**; the humanities preserve the human content, but only as ideology, at the expense of truth”_

Horkheimer criticizes positivism and neo-thomism, showing that all positivist findings rest in observation, but observation itself can not be proven, so there is a vicious cycle where what we experience is only proven by experiencing it (similar to Hume’s critique). If one day we find that our observation of events affects the truth or is actually wrong then all findings would need to be reevaluated.

_“**Both positivism and neo-Thomism are limited truths, ignoring the contradiction inherent in their principles**. Consequently, both try to assume a despotic role in the realm of thought. One tends to replace autonomous reason by the automatism of streamlined methodology, the other by the authority of a dogma”_

#### The domination of Nature and man <a href="#_prteoa3qo3al" id="_prteoa3qo3al"></a>

_**“Domination of nature involves domination of man”**_

**The more we look at Nature as **_**“mere objects in relation to human subjects**, the more is the once supposedly **autonomous subject emptied of any content,** until it finally becomes a mere name with nothing to denominate. The total transformation of each and every realm of being into a field of means leads to the liquidation of the subject who is supposed to use them. T**his gives modern industrialist society its nihilistic aspect.**  **Subjectivization, which exalts the subject, also dooms him.**_

_**The human being, in the process of his emancipation, shares the fate of the rest of his world.**  **Domination of nature involves domination of man**. Each subject not only has to take part in the subjugation of external nature, human and nonhuman, but in order to do so must subjugate nature in himself.”_

**People have always resisted domination**, from peasant peasant insurrections to **race riots** of our own day, _ **as well as in** the form of **individual crime and mental derangement**._ But revolt just becomes another tool for the system... _“**typical of our present era is the manipulation of this revolt** by the prevailing forces of civilization itself, **the use of the revolt as a means of perpetuating the very conditions by which it is stirred up and against** which it is directed.”_

**Our freedom**

**We are stuck in the patterns we created for ourselves.** In the medieval times it was difficult for an artisan to change his job, whereas today we can change it easily. But this doesn’t mean that we can change the way we think, we are

_“The greater ease of transition from one activity to another does not mean that more time is left for speculation or for deviations from established patterns. **The more devices we invent for dominating nature, the more must we serve them if we are to survive.”**_

_**“Paradoxically this increase of independence has led to a parallel increase of passivity.**_

_**The individual,** purified of all remnants of mythologies, including the mythology of objective reason, **reacts automatically, according to general patterns of adaptation...**_

_As the end result of the process, we have **on the one hand the self,**  **emptied of all substance** except its attempt to transform everything in heaven and on earth into means for its preservation, and **on the other hand an empty nature degraded to mere material,** mere stuff to be dominated, without any other purpose than that of this very domination”_

For Horkheimer the present-day man has a lot more options to choose from than before, which is not to be underestimated, **but this increased amount of choices has come with an inseparable pressure** related to the qualities of the change.

For example **the car compared to the horse has a lot more degrees of freedom, but it is a different freedom**. Riding a horse in the 1500s was something where we had more control, today… “_**It is as if the**_**  **_**innumerable laws**, regulations, and directions with which we must comply **were**  **driving the car,** not we. There are speed limits, warnings, stops, directions, and even diagrams showing the shape of the curve ahead. **Our spontaneity has been replaced by a frame of mind which compels us to discard every emotion** or idea that might impair our alertness to the impersonal demands assailing us”_

**On Art**

**Society has become increasingly cynical and meaningless**, art no longer expresses conflict against the status quo and humanity has stopped aiming for something greater than just surviving

_“Hypocrisy has turned cynical; it does not even expect to be believed. **The same voice that preaches about the higher things of life, such as art, friendship, or religion, exhorts the hearer to select a given brand of soap.**”_

_“A novel is written with its film possibilities in mind (_or a song is composed to be sold on spotify)_. **Once it was the endeavor of art,** literature, and philosophy **to express the meaning** of things and **of life**... to call reality by its rightful name**. Today nature's tongue is taken away**..._

_On the one hand, **nature has been stripped of all intrinsic value or meaning.** On the other, **man has been stripped of all aims except self preservation**…_

_Every word or sentence that hints of relations other than pragmatic is suspect.”_

**The fate of animals**

**Animals are now considered just obstructions,** for example capybaras that are said to invade Argentinian countries while in reality they actually lived there.

**This insensitivity has always existed in the west,** the early hunters saw animals just as prey while the businessman sees the landscape as a place to build and display of cigarette posters

**The evolution of individuality**

Individuality rose from the Hellenic period but started declining with liberalism.

1. **Hellenistic** period saw the rise of individuality through Socrates
2. **Christinnity** set the uniqueness of the soul and the afterlife
3. **The Renaissance** portrait through characters like Hamlet the anxiety before death (to be or not to be) but maintaining the eternal and unique soul.
4. **LIberalism** led to conformormity through commerce and exchange. Created monadic individuals, isolated due to self interest but nevertheless becoming more and more alike.
5. **Modern society** lost meaning and both things and people became fungible.

**On engineers**

_“It is true that **the engineer, perhaps the symbol of this age, is not so exclusively bent on profit making** as the industrialist or the merchant. Because his function is more directly connected with the requirements of the production job itself**, his commands bear the mark of greater objectivity.** His subordinates recognize that at least some of his orders are in the nature of things and therefore rational in a universal sense. **But at bottom this rationality pertains to domination, not reason**._

_**The engineer is not interested in understanding things for their own sake** or for the sake of insight, **but in accordance with their being fitted into a scheme**, no matter how alien to their own inner structure; this holds for living beings as well as for inanimate things. **The engineer's mind is that of industrialism in its streamlined form**. His purposeful rule would make men an agglomeration of instruments without a purpose of their own”_

**Martyrs**

_**“The real individuals of our time are the martyrs** who have gone through infernos of suffering and degradation in their resistance to conquest and oppression, **not the inflated personalities of popular culture**, the conventional dignitaries. **The anonymous martyrs of the concentration camps**  **are the symbols of the humanity that is striving to be born**. The task of philosophy is to translate what they have done into language that will be heard, even though their finite voices have been silenced by tyranny.”_

**The road forward**

Horkheim does not believe we need to go back to objective reason, we need to understand that both reasons are required and that the role of philosophy is not to guide us like a self help book but rather to help us criticize our surroundings.

So in this critical phase **reason should avoid being an instrument,** a tool for propaganda and domination, it should not only focus on the objective structure of reality neither the mere execution of means, we can see a sort of **Dialectics** being played by Horkheim where the **thesis “objective reason” and the antithesis “subjective reason” gives rise to a synthesis** rather than a simple negation of one pole or the other.

**”**_**Isolated subjective reason in our time is triumphing everywhere**, with fatal results, the critique must necessarily be carried on with an emphasis on objective reason”_ but Horkheimer warns that this is not to say that we need to chose objective reason rather _“**the two concepts are interlaced”**_

To recover we need to understand why we want to dominate nature and changing the paradigm

_“The disease of reason is that **reason was born from man's urge to dominate nature,** and the **'recovery' depends on insight into the nature of the original disease,** not on a cure of the latest symptoms”_

**“**_One might say that **the collective madness that rages today, from the concentration camps** to the seemingly most harmless mass-culture reactions, **was already present in germ in primitive objectivization, in the first man's calculating contemplation of the world as a prey**._

_**Paranoia**, the madness that builds logically constructed theories of persecution, is not merely a parody of reason, bu**t is somehow present in any form of reason that consists in the mere pursuit of aims.”**_

For Horkheimer philosophy in our age needs to help us criticize the status quo**, instead of constructive philosophy we need to go back to the socratic roots.** To fight the establishment and subjective reasons.

_“**The method of negation,** the denunciation of everything that mutilates mankind and impedes its free development**, rests on confidence in man**. The so-called constructive philosophies may be shown truly to lack this conviction and thus to be unable to face the cultural debacle._

_Now that science has helped us to overcome the awe of the unknown in nature, we are the slaves of social pressures of our own making. **When called upon to act independently, we cry for patterns, systems, and authorities**. If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate—in short, the emancipation from fear—**then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service reason can render.”**_

The problem in Horkheimer’s critique is that he claims that that reason is irrational through a theory based on reason. Resulting in an aporia, we just can’t figure the way out if we can’t use reason. A solution could be to separate instrumentality from reason (is it even possible?) or to discuss a new type of paradigm for reason (see Habermas)
